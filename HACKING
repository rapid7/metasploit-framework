Ruby 1.9: What to Expect

You can use the the "./tools/msftidy.rb" script against your new and
changed modules to do some rudimentary checking for various style and
syntax violations.

Licensing for Your New Content
==============================

By submitting code contributions to the Metasploit Project it is
assumed that you are offering your code under the Metasploit License
or similar 3-clause BSD-compatible license.  MIT and Ruby Licenses
are also fine.  We specifically cannot include GPL code. LGPL code
is accepted on a case by case basis for libraries only and is never
accepted for modules.
