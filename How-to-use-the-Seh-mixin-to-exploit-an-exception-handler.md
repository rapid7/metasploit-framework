Exception handler overwriting was once a very popular technique to exploit stack buffer overflows, but isn't so common anymore in newer programs because most likely they're compiled with SafeSEH. At one point, even with SafeSEH enabled, it was still possible to abuse an exception handler by heap spraying, but of course, memory protections didn't stop there. DEP/FASLR eventually came to the rescue, so that pretty much terminated the glory days of SEH exploits. You can probably still find vulnerable applications not compiled with SafeSEH, but chances are the app is outdated, no longer maintained, or it is more of a learning experiment for the developer. Nonetheless, exploiting a stack buffer overflow with exception handling is still fun, so if you do come across it, here's how it's supposed to be written with Metasploit's ```Seh``` mixin.

### Requirements

To be able to use the SEH mixin, some exploitable requirements must be met:

* The vulnerable program does not have SafeSEH in place.
* No DEP (Data Execution Prevention). The mixin uses a short jump to be able to execute the payload, which means the memory must be executable. DEP, as the name implies, prevents that.
