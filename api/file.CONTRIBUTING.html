<p>Thank you for your interest in making Metasploit -- and therefore, the
world -- a better place!  Before you get started, please review our <a href="./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a>. This helps us ensure our community is positive and supportive for everyone involved.</p>

<h2 id="code-free-contributions">Code Free Contributions</h2>

<p>Before we get into the details of contributing code, you should know there are multiple ways you can add to Metasploit without any coding experience:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can <a href="https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/issues/new/choose">submit bugs and feature requests</a> with detailed information about your issue or idea:

<ul>
<li>If you&#39;d like to propose a feature, describe what you&#39;d like to see. Mock ups of console views would be great.</li>
<li>If you&#39;re reporting a bug, please be sure to include the expected behaviour, the observed behaviour, and steps to reproduce the problem. Resource scripts, console copy-pastes, and any background on the environment you encountered the bug in would be appreciated. More information can be found <a href="#bug-reports">below</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/issues">Help fellow users with open issues</a>. This can require technical knowledge, but you can also get involved in conversations about bug reports and feature requests. This is a great way to get involved without getting too overwhelmed!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pulls">Help fellow committers test recently submitted pull requests</a>. Again this can require some technical skill, but by pulling down a pull request and testing it, you can help ensure our new code contributions for stability and quality.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rapid7.com/disclosure.jsp">Report a security vulnerability in Metasploit itself</a> to Rapid7. If you see something you think makes Metasploit vulnerable to an attack, let us know!</li>
<li>Add <a href="https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/basics/module-documentation.html">module documentation</a>. New documentation is always needed and cleaning up existing documents is just as important! If you&#39;re a non-native English speaker, you can help by replacing any ambiguous idioms, metaphors, or unclear language that might make our documentation hard to understand.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="code-contributions">Code Contributions</h2>

<p>For those of you who are looking to add code to Metasploit, your first step is to set up a <a href="http://r-7.co/MSF-DEV">development environment</a>. Once that&#39;s done, we recommend beginners start by adding a <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/search?verified=true&hasapp=true&nomsf=true">proof-of-concept exploit from ExploitDB,</a> as a new module to the Metasploit framework. These exploits have been verified as recreatable and their ExploitDB page includes a copy of the exploitable software. This makes testing your module locally much simpler, and most importantly the exploits don&#39;t have an existing Metasploit implementation. ExploitDB can be slow to update however, so please double check that there isn&#39;t an existing module before beginning development! If you&#39;re certain the exploit you&#39;ve chosen isn&#39;t already in Metasploit, read our <a href="https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/development/developing-modules/guides/get-started-writing-an-exploit.html">writing an exploit guide</a>. It will help you to get started and avoid some common mistakes.</p>

<p>Once you have finished your new module and tested it locally to ensure it&#39;s working as expected, check out our <a href="https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/development/maintainers/process/guidelines-for-accepting-modules-and-enhancements.html#module-additions">guide for accepting modules</a>. This will give you a good idea of how to clean up your code so that it&#39;s likely to get accepted.</p>

<p>Finally, follow our short list of do&#39;s and don&#39;ts below to make sure your valuable contributions actually make it into Metasploit&#39;s master branch! We try to consider all our pull requests fairly and in detail, but if you do not follow these rules, your contribution
will be closed. We need to ensure the code we&#39;re adding to master is written to a high standard.</p>

<h2 id="expedited-module-creation-process">Expedited Module Creation Process</h2>

<p>We strive to respect the community that has given us so much, so in the odd situation where we get multiple submissions for the same vulnerability, generally we will work with the first person who assigns themselves to the issue or the first person that submits a good-faith PR.  A good-faith PR might not even work, but it will show that the author is working their way toward a solution.  Despite this general rule, there are rare circumstances where we may ask a contributor to step aside or allow a committer to take the lead on the creation of a new module if a complete and working module with documents has not already been submitted.  This kind of expedited module creation process comes up infrequently, and usually it involves high-profile or high priority modules that we have marked internally as time-critical: think KEV list, active exploitation campaigns, CISA announcements, etc.  In those cases, we may ask a contributor that is assigned to the issue or who has submitted an incomplete module to allow a committer to take over an issue or a module PR in the interest of getting a module out quickly.  If a contributor has submitted an incomplete module, they will remain as a co-author of the module and we may build directly onto the PR they submitted, leaving the original commits in the tree.  We sincerely hope that the original author will remain involved in this expedited module creation process.  We would appreciate testing, critiquing, and any assistance that can be offered.  If the module is complete but requires minor changes, we may ask the contributor to allow us to take over testing/verification and make these minor changes without asking so we can land the module as quickly as possible.  In these cases of minor code changes, the authorship of the module will remain unchanged.  We hope everyone involved in this expedited module creation process continues to feel valued and appreciated.</p>

<h2 id="vibecoding-ai-and-llm">Vibecoding, AI, and LLM</h2>

<p>My first job had a token ring LAN and I still own a Win98SE CD, so I&#39;m not entirely sure what <em>vibecoding</em> is, but we&#39;re cool with any coding technique you use to create a PR as long as it is tested, documented, and does what it says it does.  Untested code is incomplete code, and incomplete code should be marked as a draft PR or WIP (Work in Progress) until it is complete, tested, and ready for a committer to review.  We have had several submissions clearly from AI that were well-formatted, looked really neat, and did nothing it said it did.  While we have no problem with AI-assisted coding, please do not assume that the code generated by an AI or LLM is logically or even syntactically correct.</p>

<h3 id="code-contribution-dos-donts">Code Contribution Do&#39;s &amp; Don&#39;ts:</h3>

<p>Keeping the following in mind gives your contribution the best chance of landing!</p>
