        Encodes a payload using a series of SUB instructions and writing the
        encoded value to ESP. This concept is based on the known SUB encoding
        approach that is widely used to manually encode payloads with very
        restricted allowed character sets. It will not reset EAX to zero unless
        absolutely necessary, which helps reduce the payload by 10 bytes for
        every 4-byte chunk. ADD support hasn't been included as the SUB
        instruction is more likely to avoid bad characters anyway.

        The payload requires a base register to work off which gives the start
        location of the encoder payload in memory. If not specified, it defaults
        to ESP. If the given register doesn't point exactly to the start of the
        payload then an offset value is also required.

        Note: Due to the fact that many payloads use the FSTENV approach to
        get the current location in memory there is an option to protect the
        start of the payload by setting the 'OverwriteProtect' flag to true.
        This adds 3-bytes to the start of the payload to bump ESP by 32 bytes
        so that it's clear of the top of the payload.
