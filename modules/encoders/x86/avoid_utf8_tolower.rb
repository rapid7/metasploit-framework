#
# NOTE: Read this if you plan on using this encoder:
#
# This encoder has some limitations that must be considered.  First, this
# encoder cannot be used with all of the payloads included in the framework.
# Most notably, this includes windows/shell_reverse_tcp.  The reason for this
# is that some payloads are of a size that leads to a bad character (uppercase
# character) being generated in the decoder stub header.
#
# A second thing to consider is that some IP addresses used in payloads are
# incompatible with this encoder depending on their alignment within the
# payload.  For example, the use of 127.0.0.1 may not work due to the fact
# that it's impossible to reach the bytes 127, 0, and 1 in a single add or sub
# due to the algorithm that this encoder uses.
#
# Here's a description of how it works:
#
# This encoder is pretty lame.  It has a huge size overhead.  Alas, it
# does produce tolower safe and UTF8 safe payloads.  The decoder itself is
# split into three distinct chunks.  The first chunk is the header, the second
# chunk is the inline-decoding, and the third chunk is where the decoded data
# is persisted.  Unlike most encoders, this encoder does not use any branch
# instructions and instead runs into the decoded data after it completes due
# to the fact that it is decoding inline.
#
# The basic approach taken to implement the encoder is this.  First, the
# decoder header assumes that a register (ecx) points to the first byte
# in the decoder stub.  It then proceeds to calculate the offset to the
# third chunk of the decoder (the persisted data) and updates the context
# register (ecx) to point to the first byte of the third chunk of the decoder
# stub.  Following that, the second chunk of the decoder begins executing
# which uses a series of add or subtract operations on the third chunk of the
# decoder to produce the actual opcodes of the encoded payload.  For each four
# bytes of encoded data, a sub or add instruction is used in combination with
# complementary information stored in the third chunk of the decoder.
#
# For example, in order to produce 0x01fdfeff one could do the following:
#
#   0x5e096f7c
# - 0x5c0b707d
# ------------
#   0x01fdfeff
#
# After all of the inline decoding operations complete, the payload should
# simply fall through into the now-decoded payload that was stored in the
# third chunk of the decoder.
#
# The following is an example encoding of:
#
# "\xcc\x41\xcc\x41\xcc\x41\xcc\x41\xff\xfe\xfd\x01\xff\x02\x82\x4c"
