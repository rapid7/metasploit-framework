				This module exploits a local file inclusion vulnerability in
				the Lotus Mail Encryption Server (Protector for Mail Encryption)
				administration interface. The index.php file uses an unsafe include()
				where an unauthenticated remote user may read (traversal) arbitrary file contents.
				By abusing a second bug within Lotus, we can inject our payload
				into a known location and call it via the LFI to gain remote code execution.
				Version 2.1.0.1 Build(88.3.0.1.4323) is known to be vulnerable.
				You may need to set DATE in the format YYYY-MM-DD to get this working,
				where the remote host and metasploit instance have UTC timezone differences.
