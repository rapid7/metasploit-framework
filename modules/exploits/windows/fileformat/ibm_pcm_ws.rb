      'Description'   => %q{
      The IBM Personal Communications I-Series application WorkStation is susceptible to a
      stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability within file parsing in which data copied to a
      location in memory exceeds the size of the reserved destination area. The buffer is located
      on the runtime program stack.

      When the WorkStation file is opened it will reach the code path at 0x67575180 located in
      pcspref.dll which conducts string manipulation and validation on the data supplied in the
      WorkStation file. The application will first check if 'Profile' header exists and appends
      a dot with the next parameter within the file. It will then measure the character length
      of the header by calling strcspn with a dot as its null-terminated character.

      It will then write the header into memory and ensure the header ends with a NUL character.
      The parameter character array is passed to the strcpy() function. The application has
      declared a 52-element character array for the destination for strcpy function. The
      function does not perform bounds checking therefore, data can be written paste the end of
      the buffer variable resulting in corruption of adjacent variables including other local
      variables, program state information and function arguments. You will notice that the
      saved RETURN address at offset 0x6c is overwritten by the data written past the buffer.

      To ensure we can perform arbitrary code execution we must we provide a valid pointer at
      0x74 which is used as a argument for the called function at 0x675751ED as a id file
      extension parameter. Once the caller regains control we will reach our RETURN. The Ret
      instruction will be used to pop the overwritten saved return address which was currupted.

      This exploit has been written to bypass 2 mitigations DEP and ASLR on a Windows platform.
