      'Description'	=> %q{
      This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Alt-N MDaemon SMTP server for
      versions 6.8.5 and earlier. When WorldClient HTTP server is installed (default),
      a CGI script is provided to accept html FORM based emails and deliver via MDaemon.exe,
      by writing the CGI output to the Raw Queue. When X-FromCheck is enabled (also default),
      the temporary form2raw.cgi data is copied by MDaemon.exe and a stack based
      overflow occurs when an excessively long From field is specified.
      The RawQueue is processed every 1 minute by default, to a maximum of 60 minutes.
      Keep this in mind when choosing payloads or setting WfsDelay... You'll need to wait.

      Furthermore, this exploit uses a direct memory jump into a nopsled (which isn't very
      reliable). Once the payload is written into the Raw Queue by Form2Raw, MDaemon will
      continue to crash/execute the payload until the CGI output is manually deleted
      from the queue in C:\MDaemon\RawFiles\*.raw.
