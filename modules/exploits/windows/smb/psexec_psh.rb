          This module uses a valid administrator username and password to execute a powershell
        payload using a similar technique to the "psexec" utility provided by SysInternals. The
        payload is encoded in base64 and executed from the commandline using the -encodedcommand
        flag. Using this method, the payload is never written to disk, and given that each payload
        is unique, is less prone to signature based detection. A persist option is provided to
        execute the payload in a while loop in order to maintain a form of persistence. In the
        event of a sandbox observing PSH execution, a delay and other obfuscation may be added to
        avoid detection. In order to avoid interactive process notifications for the current user,
        the psh payload has been reduced in size and wrapped in a powershell invocation which hides
        the window entirely.
