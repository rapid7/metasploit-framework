      'Name'           => 'Microsoft SQL Server Payload Execution via SQL Injection',
      'Description'    => %q{
          This module will execute an arbitrary payload on a Microsoft SQL
        Server, using a SQL injection vulnerability.

        Once a vulnerability is identified this module
        will use xp_cmdshell to upload and execute Metasploit payloads.
        It is necessary to specify the exact point where the SQL injection
        vulnerability happens. For example, given the following injection:

        http://www.example.com/show.asp?id=1;exec xp_cmdshell 'dir';--&cat=electrical

        you would need to set the following path:
        set GET_PATH /showproduct.asp?id=1;[SQLi];--&cat=foobar

        In regard to the payload, unless there is a closed port in the web server,
        you dont want to use any "bind" payload, specially on port 80, as you will
        stop reaching the vulnerable web server host. You want a "reverse" payload, probably to
        your port 80 or to any other outbound port allowed on the firewall.
        For privileged ports execute Metasploit msfconsole as root.

        Currently, three delivery methods are supported.

        First, the original method uses Windows 'debug.com'. File size restrictions are
        avoidied by incorporating the debug bypass method presented by SecureStat at
        Defcon 17. Since this method invokes ntvdm, it is not available on x86_64 systems.

        A second method takes advantage of the Command Stager subsystem. This allows using
        various techniques, such as using a TFTP server, to send the executable. By default
        the Command Stager uses 'wcsript.exe' to generate the executable on the target.

        Finally, ReL1K's latest method utilizes PowerShell to transmit and recreate the
        payload on the target.

        NOTE: This module will leave a payload executable on the target system when the
        attack is finished.
