          This module targets ZDI-20-704 (aka CVE-2020-10924), a buffer overflow vulnerability in the UPNP daemon (/usr/sbin/upnpd),
          on Netgear R6700v3 routers running firmware versions from V1.0.2.62 up to but not including V1.0.4.94, to reset
          the password for the 'admin' user back to its factory default of 'password'. Authentication is bypassed by
          using ZDI-20-703 (aka CVE-2020-10923), an authentication bypass that occurs when network adjacent
          computers send SOAPAction UPnP messages to a vulnerable Netgear R6700v3 router. Currently this module only
          supports exploiting Netgear R6700v3 routers running either the V1.0.0.4.82_10.0.57 or V1.0.0.4.84_10.0.58
          firmware, however support for other firmware versions may be added in the future.

          Once the password has been reset, attackers can use the exploit/linux/telnet/netgear_telnetenable module to send a
          special packet to port 23/udp of the router to enable a telnet server on port 23/tcp. The attacker can
          then log into this telnet server using the new password, and obtain a shell as the "root" user.

          These last two steps have to be done manually, as the authors did not reverse the communication with the web interface.
          It should be noted that successful exploitation will result in the upnpd binary crashing on the target router.
          As the upnpd binary will not restart until the router is rebooted, this means that attackers can only exploit
          this vulnerability once per reboot of the router.

          This vulnerability was discovered and exploited at Pwn2Own Tokyo 2019 by the Flashback team (Pedro Ribeiro +
          Radek Domanski).
