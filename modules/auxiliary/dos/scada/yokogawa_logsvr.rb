        This module abuses a buffer overflow vulnerability to trigger a Denial of Service
        of the BKCLogSvr component in the Yokogaca CENTUM CS 3000 product. The vulnerability
        exists in the handling of malformed log packets, with an unexpected long level field.
        The root cause of the vulnerability is a combination of usage of uninitialized memory
        from the stack and a dangerous string copy. This module has been tested successfully
        on Yokogawa CENTUM CS 3000 R3.08.50.
