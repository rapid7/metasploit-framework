This is the folder where all of Metasploit's modules live. These modules are scripts in Ruby that interface with
Metasploit itself to perform some specific task. There are various types of modules, such as `exploit` modules to
exploit a vulnerability and gain a shell, `auxiliary` to perform a non-shell gaining activity, `payloads` for
Metasploit's various payloads (which are also modules), and `post` for post exploitation modules.
