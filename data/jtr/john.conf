/* Awesome Password Generator RNG replay
 * Written by Michael Samuel <mik@miknet.net>
 * Public Domain.
 *
 * This takes advantage of a subtle bug, where a crypto RNG is used to
 * seed the C# System.Random() class, which takes a 32-bit input, but
 * converts negative numbers into non-negative numbers, resulting in
 * only 31 bits of security.
 *
 * This only implements "easy to type" being *unticked*, and numbers,
 * lowers, uppers and symbols being ticked, in random password mode.
 * Changing the password length is easy, anything else is left as an
 * exercise to the reader.
 *
 * Running Awesome Password Generator (1.3.2 or lower) in Mono is still
 * vulnerable, but uses a different RNG, so this mode isn't compatible.
 */

/* Awesome Password Generator 1.3.2 does a two-pass run, selecting which
 * charset each position will have, then picking the character.  This
 * leads to heavy bias, and is fixed in 1.4.0 (along with many other
 * fixes).  If you have been using Awesome Password Generator, you should
 * upgrade immediately and change your passwords.

# Reference example hybrid-mode external. same as jtr-rule: $[0-9]$[0-9]

# will get new() called with each word, and then have next() called, until
# the word[0]=0 is seen (meaning all candidates for the base word have been
# generated.  Prior to new() or restore(), word[] is the 'base' word.
# if the script is able to properly resume, then it should set the global
# variable hybrid_total to the count of candidates that will be generated
# for this word (in new() / restore(), then in the body of restore() there
# is a global variable set 'hybrid_resume' that was the prior number of
# canidates generated for this base-word.  Resume should start at the NEXT
# If the script is not able to easily resume, then simply do NOT set the
# global hybrid_total to anything either function.  JtR will 'still' resume
# propery, but it will do so by calling new()/next()/next().../next() until
# back to the proper resume location.
#
# script changed to append a _ character before the number, each time within
# the next() function. Done this way to better validate that -restore within
# jtr is working properly.
