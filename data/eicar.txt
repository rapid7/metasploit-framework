The eicar.com file in this directory is NOT A VIRUS. Instead, it is the industry standard
anti-virus/anti-malware test file. We have included this file in the source tree of the 
Metasploit Framework so that the installed copy of Metasploit may determine whether or
not an installed anti-virus program is interfering with the operation of Metasploit.

A number of files within the Metasploit Framework source tree are often flagged by
anti-virus and anti-malware programs. All of these files are completely safe to the user
operating the framework. However, when anti-virus programs try to quarantine these files
they often leave the framework in a broken state, leading to a poor user experience.

The EICAR file is used as a canary to determine whether an anti-virus program is
responsible for corrupting the Metasploit Framework installation.
