This folder contains various data files used for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to banners for the
console, exploit source code for exploits (under `data/exploits`), template code and binaries, wordlists and shellcode.

As a general rule of thumb this folder will most often be used when you are using compiled binaries or source code from
other exploits for cases such as local privilege escalation exploits and need to provide the exploit code and compiled
binaries so that maintainers can verify the binary and compile it themselves, as so that modules can find the R7 compiled
version of the resulting binary for use during exploitation.
