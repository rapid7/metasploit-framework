Installing
--

Generally, you should use [the free installer](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/getting-started/nightly-installers.html),
which contains all of the dependencies and will get you up and running with a
few clicks. See the [Dev Environment Setup](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/development/get-started/setting-up-a-metasploit-development-environment.html) if
you'd like to deal with dependencies on your own.

Using Metasploit
--
Metasploit can do all sorts of things. The first thing you'll want to do
is start `msfconsole`, but after that, you'll probably be best served by
reading the basics of [using Metasploit](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/basics/using-metasploit.html)
or [Metasploit Unleashed][unleashed].

Contributing
--
See the [Dev Environment Setup][devenv] guide on GitHub, which will
walk you through the whole process from installing all the
dependencies, to cloning the repository, and finally to submitting a
pull request. For slightly more information, see
[Contributing](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
