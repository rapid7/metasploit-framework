# Hello, World!

Thanks for your interest in making Metasploit -- and therefore, the
world -- a better place!

Are you about to report a bug? Sorry to hear it. Here's our [Issue tracker].
Please try to be as specific as you can about your problem; include steps
to reproduce (cut and paste from your console output if it's helpful) and
what you were expecting to happen.

Are you about to report a security vulnerability in Metasploit itself?
How ironic! Please take a look at Rapid7's [Vulnerability
Disclosure Policy](https://www.rapid7.com/disclosure.jsp), and send
your report to security@rapid7.com using our [PGP key].

Are you about to contribute some new functionality, a bug fix, or a new
Metasploit module? If so, read on...

# Contributing to Metasploit

What you see here in CONTRIBUTING.md is a bullet point list of the do's
and don'ts of how to make sure *your* valuable contributions actually
make it into Metasploit's master branch.

If you care not to follow these rules, your contribution **will** be
closed. Sorry!

This is intended to be a **short** list. The [wiki] is much more
exhaustive and reveals many mysteries. If you read nothing else, take a
look at the standard [development environment setup] guide
and Metasploit's [Common Coding Mistakes].

## Code Contributions

* **Do** stick to the [Ruby style guide].
* **Do** get [Rubocop] relatively quiet against the code you are adding or modifying.
* **Do** follow the [50/72 rule] for Git commit messages.
* **Don't** use the default merge messages when merging from other branches.
* **Do** create a [topic branch] to work on instead of working directly on `master`.
* **Do** license your code as BSD 3-clause, BSD 2-clause, or MIT.

### Pull Requests

* **Do** target your pull request to the **master branch**. Not staging, not develop, not release.
* **Do** specify a descriptive title to make searching for your pull request easier.
* **Do** include [console output], especially for witnessable effects in `msfconsole`.
* **Do** list [verification steps] so your code is testable.
* **Do** [reference associated issues] in your pull request description
* **Do** write [release notes] once a pull request is landed
* **Don't** leave your pull request description blank.
* **Don't** abandon your pull request. Being responsive helps us land your code faster.

Pull requests [PR#2940] and [PR#3043] are a couple good examples to follow.

#### New Modules

* **Do** run `tools/dev/msftidy.rb` against your module and fix any errors or warnings that come up.
  - It would be even better to set up `msftidy.rb` as a [pre-commit hook].
* **Do** use the many module mixin [API]s. Wheel improvements are welcome; wheel reinventions, not so much.
* **Don't** include more than one module per pull request.
* **Do** include instructions on how to setup the vulnerable environment or software
* **Do** include [Module Documentation](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Generating-Module-Documentation) showing sample run-throughs



#### Scripts

* **Don't** submit new [scripts].  Scripts are shipped as examples for
  automating local tasks, and anything "serious" can be done with post
  modules and local exploits.

#### Library Code

* **Do** write [RSpec] tests - even the smallest change in library land can thoroughly screw things up.
* **Do** follow [Better Specs] - it's like the style guide for specs.
* **Do** write [YARD] documentation - this makes it easier for people to use your code.
* **Don't** fix a lot of things in one pull request. Small fixes are easier to validate.

#### Bug Fixes

* **Do** include reproduction steps in the form of verification steps.
* **Do** include a link to any corresponding [Issues] in the format of
  `See #1234` in your commit description.

## Bug Reports

* **Do** report vulnerabilities in Rapid7 software directly to security@rapid7.com.
* **Do** write a detailed description of your bug and use a descriptive title.
* **Do** include reproduction steps, stack traces, and anything else that might help us verify and fix your bug.
* **Don't** file duplicate reports; search for your bug before filing a new report.

If you need some more guidance, talk to the main body of open
source contributors over on the [Freenode IRC channel],
or e-mail us at the [metasploit-hackers] mailing list.

Also, **thank you** for taking the few moments to read this far! You're
already way ahead of the curve, so keep it up!
