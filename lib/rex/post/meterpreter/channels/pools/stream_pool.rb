#
# StreamPool
# ----------
#
# This class represents a channel that is associated with a
# streaming pool that has no definite end-point.  While this
# may seem a paradox given the stream class of channels, it's
# in fact dinstinct because streams automatically forward
# traffic between the two ends of the channel whereas
# stream pools are always requested data in a single direction.
