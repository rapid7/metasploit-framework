module Msf

####
# Allows for staging cmd to arbitrary payloads through the CmdStagerEcho.
#
# This stager uses the echo's "-e" flag, that enable interpretation of
# backslash escapes, to drop an ELF with the payload embedded to disk.
# The "-e" flag is usually available on linux environments. This stager
# has been found useful on restricted linux based embedded devices, and
# should work on either:
# * Systems with busy box's echo binary somewhere in $PATH.
# * Systems with bash/zsh whose echo builtin supports -en flags.
# * Systems with GNU coreutils echo which supports -en flags.
