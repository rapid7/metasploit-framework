== Description
  The win32-service library allows you to control or create MS Windows services.

== Installation
  gem install win32-service                        # Build from source
  gem install win32-service --platform x86-mingw32 # Install binary

== Synopsis
  require 'win32/service'

  # Iterate over the available services
  Service.services do |service|
    p service
  end

== More Documentation
  Please see the documentation in the 'doc' directory, or the gem documentation
  that was installed when you installed this library as a gem.

== Known Issues
=== Problem:
  Service.delete causes "Unable to delete: The specified service has been
  marked for deletion."
 
=== Troubleshooting:
  This can be caused by one of two things. Either you attempted to delete a
  running service without stopping it first, or you have the Services
  Administrative Tool (GUI) open. In the former case, the solution is to first
  stop the service if it's running. In the latter, close the Services GUI
  admin tool before deleting.
	
=== Problem:
  Service.start causes, "The service did not respond to the start or control
  request in a timely fashion."

=== Troubleshooting:
  The best way to debug your services is to wrap your entire Daemon subclass
  in a begin/end block and send error messages to a file. That should give a
  good clue as to the nature of the problem. The most probable culprits are:

  * You've tried to require a library that's not in your $LOAD_PATH. Make sure
  that your require statements are inside the begin/rescue block so that you can
  easily find those mistakes.

  * Your have a bad binary path name. Be sure to use an absolute path name for
  the binary path name, including the full path to the Ruby interpreter, e.g.
  'c:\ruby\bin\ruby' instead of just 'ruby'.

  * You've got a syntax error in your code somewhere.
