  # Attempts to locate the included module object.  Returns the name if not
  # known.
  #
  # The scoping rules of Ruby to resolve the name of an included module are:
  # - first look into the children of the current context;
  # - if not found, look into the children of included modules,
  #   in reverse inclusion order;
  # - if still not found, go up the hierarchy of names.
  #
  # This method has <code>O(n!)</code> behavior when the module calling
  # include is referencing nonexistent modules.  Avoid calling #module until
  # after all the files are parsed.  This behavior is due to ruby's constant
  # lookup behavior.
  #
  # As of the beginning of October, 2011, no gem includes nonexistent modules.
