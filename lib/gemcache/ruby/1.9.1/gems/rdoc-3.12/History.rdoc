=== 3.10 / 2011-10-08

* Major enhancements
  * RDoc HTML output has been improved:
    * The search from Володя Колесников's (Vladimir Kolesnikov) Sdoc has been
      integrated.

      The search index generation is a reusable component through
      RDoc::Generator::JsonIndex
    * The table of contents is now a separate page and now shows links to
      headings and sections inside a page or class.
    * Class pages no longer show the namespace and no longer have file info
      pages.
    * HTML output is HTML 5.
    * Static files can be copied into RDoc using --copy-files
  * RDoc supports additional documentation formats:
    * TomDoc 1.0.0-rc1
    * RD format

    The default markup can be set via the <tt>--markup</tt> option.

    The format of documentation in a particular file can be specified by the
    +:markup:+ directive.  If the +:markup:+ directive is in the first comment
    it is used as the default for the entire file.  For other comments it
    overrides the default markup format.

    The markup format can be set for rake tasks using RDoc::Task#markup
  * RDoc can save and load an options file.

    To create an options file that defaults to using TomDoc markup run:

      rdoc --markup tomdoc --write-options

    This will create a .rdoc_options file.  Check it in to your VCS and
    package it with your gem.  RDoc will automatically load this file and
    combine it with the user's options.

    Some options are not saved.  See RDoc::Options@Saved+Options for full
    details.

* Minor enhancements
  * RDoc autoloads everything.  You only need to require 'rdoc' now.
  * HTML headings now have ids matching their titles.

      = Hello!

    Is rendered as

      <h1 id="label-Hello%21">Hello!</h1>

  * Labels for classes or methods can be linked-to by adding an <tt>@</tt>
    following the class or method reference.  For example,
    <tt>RDoc::Markup@Links</tt>

    See RDoc::Markup@Links for further details.
  * For HTML output RDoc uses +SomeClass.method_name+ and
    +SomeClass#method_name+ for remote methods and attributes and
    +::method_name+ and +#method_name+ for local methods.
  * RDoc makes an effort to syntax-highlight ruby code in verbatim sections.
    See RDoc::Markup@Paragraphs+and+Verbatim
  * Added RDoc::TopLevel#text? and RDoc::Parser::Text to indicate a
    parsed file contains no ruby constructs.
  * Added <tt>rdoc-label</tt> link scheme which allows bidirectional links.
    See RDoc::Markup for details.
  * Image paths at HTTPS URLs will now be turned into +<img>+ tags.  Pull
    Request #60 by James Mead
  * Added RDoc::Comment which encapsulates comment-handling functionality.
  * Added RDoc::Markup::PreProcess::post_process to allow arbitrary comment
    munging.
  * RDoc::RDoc::current is set for the entire RDoc run.
  * Split rdoc/markup/inline into individual files for its component classes.
  * Moved token stream HTML markup out of RDoc::AnyMethod#markup_code into
    RDoc::TokenStream::to_html
  * "Top" link in section headers is no longer inside the heading element.
  * RDoc avoids printing some warnings unless run with `rdoc --verbose`.  For
    Rails issue #1646.
  * Finishing a paragraph with two or more spaces will result in a line break.
    This feature is experimental and may be modified or removed.

* Bug fixes
  * Markup defined by RDoc::Markup#add_special inside a <tt><tt></tt> is no
    longer converted.
  * Performance of RDoc::RubyLex has been improved.  Ruby Bug #5202 by Ryan
    Melton.
  * Add US-ASCII magic comments to work with <tt>ruby -Ku</tt>.  Issue #63 by
    Travis D. Warlick, Jr.

    Hogan.
  * Fixed RDoc::Markup::Parser for CRLF line endings.  Issue #67 by Marvin
    Gülker.
  * Fixed lexing of percent strings like %r{#}.  Issue #68 by eclectic923.
  * The C parser now understands classes defined with
    +rb_struct_define_without_accessor+ (like Range).  Pull Request #73 by Dan
    Bernier
  * Fixed lexing of <code>a b <<-HEREDOC</code>.  Issue #75 by John Mair.
  * Added LEGAL.rdoc with references to licenses in other files.  Issue #78 by
    Dmitry Jemerov.
  * Block parameters are displayed in Darkfish output again.  Issue #76 by
    Andrea Singh.
  * The method parameter coverage report no longer includes parameter default
    values.  Issue #77 by Jake Goulding.
  * The module for an include is not looked up until parsed all the files are
    parsed.  Unless your project includes nonexistent modules this avoids
    worst-case behavior (<tt>O(n!)</tt>) of RDoc::Include#module.

=== 3.9.2 / 2011-08-11

  * RDoc::Parser::C now supports :doc: and :nodoc: for class comments
  * Added the <tt>rdoc-ref:</tt> link scheme which links to a named reference.
    <tt>rdoc-ref:</tt> can resolve references to classes, modules, methods,
    files, etc.  This can be used to create cross-generator named links unlike
    the <tt>link:</tt> scheme which is dependent upon the exact file name.
    Issue #53 by Simon Chiang
  * Pulled RDoc::CrossReference out of RDoc::Markup::ToHtmlCrossref.
    Cross-references can now be created easily for non-HTML formatters.
* Bug fixes

  gem install rdoc-data

then run:

  rdoc-data --install

To have ri data for you gems you'll also need to run:

  gem rdoc --all --overwrite

If you don't want to rebuild the rdoc for `gem server`, add --no-rdoc.

=== 2.2.1 / 2008-09-24
This version provides some minor fixes and enhancements to 2.2.0 intended
to polish RDoc for Ruby 1.9.1.

* 3 Minor Enhancements
  * Support for parsing RDoc from SWIG.  Ruby patch #10742 by Gonzalo
    Garramuno, #13993 by Steven Jenkins.
  * Simple support for Perl POD documentation.  Patch by Hugh Sasse.
  * Changed the default character set of RDoc's output from iso-8859-1 to
    utf-8.

* 9 Bug Fixes
  * Explicitly set the html template's text color, so that the generated
    documentation will display correctly on browsers with custom text and
    background color settings (patch by Luther Thompson).
  * Ensure that RDoc correctly will associate an alias and a method, even
    if it encounters the alias first because the alias lives in a different
    file.
  * Fix the parsing of multiline constants (patch by Chris Alfeld and
    Joel VanderWerf)
  * Make --exclude usuable.  Ruby patch #11671 by Trans.
  * Detect inline C functions.  Ruby Bug #11993 by Florian Frank.
  * Fix an issue in which RDoc might not document a class'
    superclass correctly if the class was defined in multiple files and
    depending on the order in which RDoc processed the files.  This should
    ensure that the child class -> parent class relationship is correct in
    ri documentation, allowing ri to lookup inherited methods (i.e., File.read).
  * Stop ri from crashing when it looks for a completely bogus method (i.e.,
    File#reada).  Now, ri exits with a helpful error message.
  * Fixed missing display of constant values in ri.
  * Fixed display of constants in ri's html output.

=== 2.2.0 / 2008-09-19
This version includes some significant enhancements to ri.  See RI.txt for
documentation about ri.

* 5 Major Enhancements
  * More extensive unit tests (special thanks to Chris Lowis for contributing
    a test).
  * Made ri twice as fast for the most common use case of displaying
    information for a class or a fully-qualified method
    (i.e., ri Array#flatten, after ri has created a cache the first time that
    it runs).
  * Made ri many times faster when searching for an unqualified method (i.e.,
    ri read, again after the first such search has populated ri's cache)
  * Changed ri to do regular expression searches for unqualified methods;
    now, a regular expression for a method can be passed to ri on the
    command-line.
  * Added an interactive mode to ri (patch by Daniel Choi).  Now, when ri
    is given a -i argument, it will allow the user to disambiguate
    unqualified methods if more than one is present and also will allow a
    user to get information for a class' method.

* 8 Minor Enhancements
  * RDoc now adds the package title to the web pages that it generates
    for files and classes/modules, which helps them appear better in
    search engine results.
  * RDoc now automatically generates cross-reference links for classes and
    methods specified relative to the global namespace (i.e., ::A::B::C#method).
  * All built-in templates now output valid, strict XHTML.
  * The documentation is slightly better organized (the markup details were
    merged into the RDoc module's documentation).
  * Improved rdoc's HTML generation speed by about 20% (on Windows, the
    boost seems larger).
  * Provided an ri command-line option to control its caching behavior.
  * Improved RDoc's documentation.  Added RI.txt to document ri.
  * Allow HTML templates distributed as gems to be loaded with the -T option,
    just like the standard templates in rdoc/generator/html (so an HTML
    template lib/new_template.rb in a gem can be used with rdoc -T new_template)

* 25 Bug fixes:
  * Fixed prototype detection in C parser.  Can process ruby 1.8 C files
    again.
  * Fixed the main page for frameless template.  Patch by Marcin Raczkowski.
  * Fixed the main page for frame templates.  Now, if no main page is
    specified, RDoc will default to the README.
  * Fixed missing stylesheet in generated chm.  Patch by Gordon Thiesfeld.
  * Fixed the parsing of module names starting with '::'.  Patch by
    Giuseppe Bilotta.
  * Fixed a case where RDoc first would encounter Foo::Bar and then would
    encounter class Foo.  Previously, RDoc erroneously would have considered
    that both a Foo class and a Foo module existed.
  * Fix a clase where RDoc would not generate correct cross-reference links
    to a class contained within a module of the same name (i.e. RDoc::RDoc)
  * Prevented RDoc from trying to parse binary files, which would produce
    garbage output.
  * RDoc now correctly converts ' characters to apostrophes, opening single
    quotes, and closing single quotes in most cases (smart single quotes).
  * RDoc now correctly converts " characters to opening double quotes and
    and closing double quotes in most cases (smart double quotes).
  * (c) correctly is converted into the copyright symbol.
  * '&' characters in text now correctly are translated to HTML character codes.
  * Fixed missing stylesheet in generated chm.  Patch by Gordon Thiesfeld.
  * Fixed broken method links in the built-in templates.
  * RDoc properly links to files and classes in the one page HTML template.
  * The kilmer and hefss templates properly syntax highlight when inlining
    source code.
  * The kilmer and hefss template class pages properly display methods again.
  * Fixed broken class, file, and method links in the frameless template.
  * Fixed the clipping of source code in the html and frameless templates when
    the source code cannot fit into the window; a scrollbar now will allow
    all of the source code to be viewed.
  * Fixed the missing constant descriptions in the html and frameless
    templates.
  * Fixed the ri command-line options that customize the directories to be
    searched for documentation.
  * Fixed the XML generator.  Patch by Anthony Durity.
  * Stopped the XML template from generating invalid XML due to malformed
    embedded ruby.
  * Adding missing information about a class' constants to the XML template.
  * Fixed the horizontal rule markup (---) so that it correctly adds a
    horizontal rule rather than suppressing all text that follows.

=== 2.1.0 / 2008-07-20

* 3 Major Enhancements:
  * RDoc now knows about meta-programmed methods, see RDoc::Parser::Ruby
  * Reorganized parsers under RDoc::Parser base class
  * ri now walks the ancestors of a class looking for a method e.g. ri
    File#read displays documentation for IO#read (may require regeneration of
    ri data)

  * Allow links to files
  * Default options now taken from RDOCOPT environment variable
  * Class method documentation can be found at toplevel now (def X.foo)
  * Allow HTML templates distributed as gems to be loaded with the -T option,
    just like the standard templates in rdoc/generator/html (so an HTML
    template lib/new_template.rb in a gem can be used with rdoc -T new_template)
  * `rdoc -v` prints out files, classes, modules and methods as it goes
* 11 Bug Fixes:
  * `ri Foo.bar` now looks for class methods also
