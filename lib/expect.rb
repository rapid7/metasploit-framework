# Expect library adds the IO instance method #expect, which does similar act to
# tcl's expect extension.
#
# In order to use this method, you must require expect:
#
#   require 'expect'
#
# Please see #expect for usage.
class IO
  # call-seq:
  #   IO#expect(pattern,timeout=9999999)                  ->  Array
  #   IO#expect(pattern,timeout=9999999) { |result| ... } ->  nil
  #
  # Reads from the IO until the given +pattern+ matches or the +timeout+ is over.
  #
  # It returns an array with the read buffer, followed by the matches.
  # If a block is given, the result is yielded to the block and returns nil.
  #
  # When called without a block, it waits until the input that matches the
  # given +pattern+ is obtained from the IO or the time specified as the
  # timeout passes. An array is returned when the pattern is obtained from the
  # IO. The first element of the array is the entire string obtained from the
  # IO until the pattern matches, followed by elements indicating which the
  # pattern which matched to the anchor in the regular expression.
  #
  # The optional timeout parameter defines, in seconds, the total time to wait
  # for the pattern.  If the timeout expires or eof is found, nil is returned
  # or yielded.  However, the buffer in a timeout session is kept for the next
  # expect call.  The default timeout is 9999999 seconds.
