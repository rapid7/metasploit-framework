This folder contains files to assist in using Metasploit with other tools such as `burp-proxy`, `vscode` and `zsh`.
It also contains `serialport`, which is a Rapid7 fork of the original `ruby-serialport` project provided by
RubyForge.org. Most importantly though, it contains the `source` directory, which contains source code for all
compiled binaries in Metasploit Framework so that users can verify the code being used.
