/*
 * rfbproto.h - header file for the RFB protocol version 3.3
 *
 * Uses types CARD<n> for an n-bit unsigned integer, INT<n> for an n-bit signed
 * integer (for n = 8, 16 and 32).
 *
 * All multiple byte integers are in big endian (network) order (most
 * significant byte first).  Unless noted otherwise there is no special
 * alignment of protocol structures.
 *
 *
 * Once the initial handshaking is done, all messages start with a type byte,
 * (usually) followed by message-specific data.  The order of definitions in
 * this file is as follows:
 *
 *  (1) Structures used in several types of message.
 *  (2) Structures used in the initial handshaking.
 *  (3) Message types.
 *  (4) Encoding types.
 *  (5) For each message type, the form of the data following the type byte.
 *      Sometimes this is defined by a single structure but the more complex
 *      messages have to be explained by comments.

 * Protocol Version
 *
 * The server always sends 12 bytes to start which identifies the latest RFB
 * protocol version number which it supports.  These bytes are interpreted
 * as a string of 12 ASCII characters in the format "RFB xxx.yyy\n" where
 * xxx and yyy are the major and minor version numbers (for version 3.3
 * this is "RFB 003.003\n").
 *
 * The client then replies with a similar 12-byte message giving the version
 * number of the protocol which should actually be used (which may be different
 * to that quoted by the server).
 *
 * It is intended that both clients and servers may provide some level of
 * backwards compatibility by this mechanism.  Servers in particular should
 * attempt to provide backwards compatibility, and even forwards compatibility
 * to some extent.  For example if a client demands version 3.1 of the
 * protocol, a 3.0 server can probably assume that by ignoring requests for
 * encoding types it doesn't understand, everything will still work OK.  This
 * will probably not be the case for changes in the major version number.
 *
 * The format string below can be used in sprintf or sscanf to generate or
 * decode the version string respectively.

 *    If this bit is set then the SubrectsColoured bit must be zero.
 *
 * AnySubrects - if set, a single byte follows giving the number of
 *    subrectangles following.  If not set, there are no subrectangles (i.e.
 *    the whole tile is just solid background colour).
 *
 * SubrectsColoured - if set then each subrectangle is preceded by a pixel
 *    value giving the colour of that subrectangle.  If not set, all
 *    subrectangles are the same colour, the foreground colour;  if the
 *    ForegroundSpecified bit wasn't set then the foreground is the same as
 *    the last tile.
 *
