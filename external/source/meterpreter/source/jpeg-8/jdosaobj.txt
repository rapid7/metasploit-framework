This archive contains already-assembled object files for JMEMDOSA.ASM
of the Independent JPEG Group's JPEG package.  These files will be helpful
if you want to compile the IJG code for DOS, but don't have an assembler.

These files were prepared from the 3/13/1992 version of JMEMDOSA.ASM,
which is still unchanged as of mid-1998.  You can use these files with
releases 3 through 6 of the IJG code, and probably future releases too.

To use these files, copy the proper version to JMEMDOSA.OBJ.  Make sure
this file has a newer date than JMEMDOSA.ASM.  Then compile the code as
usual.

Object files included:

JDOSAMSC.OBJ	For Microsoft C version 5 or later.
JDOSABCC.OBJ	For Borland C version 3.0 or later.
