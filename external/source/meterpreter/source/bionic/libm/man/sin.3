.Sh NAME
.Nm sin ,
.Nm sinf
.Nd sine functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn sin "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn sinf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sin
and the
.Fn sinf
functions compute the sine of
.Fa x
(measured in radians).
A large magnitude argument may yield a result with little
or no significance.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn sin
and the
.Fn sinf
functions return the sine value.
