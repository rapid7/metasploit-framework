.Sh NAME
.Nm cbrt ,
.Nm cbrtf ,
.Nm sqrt ,
.Nm sqrtf
.Nd cube root and square root functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn cbrt "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn cbrtf "float x"
.Ft double
.Fn sqrt "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn sqrtf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn cbrt
and the
.Fn cbrtf
functions compute
the cube root of
.Ar x .
.Pp
The
.Fn sqrt
and the
.Fn sqrtf
functions compute the
non-negative square root of x.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn cbrt
and the
.Fn cbrtf
functions return the requested cube root.
The
.Fn sqrt
and the
.Fn sqrtf
functions return the requested square root
unless an error occurs.
An attempt to take the
.Fn sqrt
of negative
.Fa x
raises an invalid exception and causes an \*(Na to be returned.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fenv 3 ,
.Xr math 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn sqrt
function conforms to
.St -isoC .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn cbrt
function appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
