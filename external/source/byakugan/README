Byakugan - Increase Your Sight
	Pusscat		Lin0xx

NOTE: If you trust me, skip to 4a. - I've already included built libs.

A. Building / Installation
	1. Requirements
		a. Windows Server 2003 DDK
		b. Debugging Tools For Windows
			- Install to C:\windbg\ - or injectsu will not be found
			- Make sure to install with the custom setting
			- Explicitly choose to install the SDK
	2. Fixing the WinDBG SDK
		a. Find the sdk/inc/wdbgexts.h file in the windbg directory
		b. Add the following like to the file after the _WDBGEXTS_ definition:
			#define __field_ecount_opt(x) ()
	3. Building the libraries
		a. Open a Windows Server 2003 Free x86 Build Environment (from the DDK)
		b. Go to the byakugan base directory
		c. type: setup
		
	4. Installation
		a. copy injectsu\i386\injectsu.dll C:\windbg\
		b. copy bin\detoured.dll C:\windows\system32\
		c. copy i386\byakugan.dll C:\windbg\

B. Deployment:
	1.	Start up windbg and attach to (or start up) a new process
		a. Ensure that both process are at the same priv level,
		   so they can both access the named pipe 
		b. Load the byakugan dll:
			!load C:\windbg\byakugan.dll
		c. Display options with !byakugan command if desired

C. Testing:
	1. testPattern
		a. This tests the pattern matcher in byakugan
		b. Build and run in windbg
		c. on crash you should be able to type:
			!pattern_offset 500

			And have it give you the registers you control,
			and at what offset into the buffer they occur
	2. testTenketsu
		a. This tests the heap visualization in byakugan
		b. Build and run in windbg
		c. On the first break, type
			!tenketsu listHeaps
			
			to find the heap containing the chunks you see (should say 11),
			then type

			!tenketsu listChunks <heap base>

			to list the chunks information
		d. Let it go, then when it breaks again, check the chunks again,
		   and it should show half of them as freed.  You can for fun try to
		   find out what that extra allocation is for. Should be pretty simple.

D. Usage:
	1. Tenketsu (Heap Visualization)
        a. Load tenketsu heap visualization with:
            !tenketsu
        b. When process is broken, display heaps with
            !tenketsu listHeaps
        c. Display chunks with
            !tenketsu listChunks <heap base>
	2. Jutsu (Buffer Handling)
		a. Register input with !jutsu identBuf <bufname> <CONTENTS>
		b. Can also autoregister MSF pattern bufs with !jutsu identBuf msfpattern <size>
		c. List registered buffers with !jutsu listBuf
		d. Remove registered buffers with !jutsu rmBuf <name>
		e. After crash, type !jutsu hunt to find out:
			1. What buffer caused a crash
			2. What registers you've overwritten (and if pattern, at what offset)
			3. What registers point at what buffers
			4. What corruption has occured (toupper, tolower, etc)
		f. Use !jutsu findReturn to find valid return addresses
			1. hunt will use all knowledge about controlled registers and buffer offsets
			   to find all possible usable return addresses
		g. Use !jutsu searchOpcode to fine opcodes in executable memory
			1. delimit instructions with pipes - example:

			0:000> !jutsu searchOpcode  pop ecx | pop ecx | ret
			[J] Searching for:
			>  pop ecx
			>  pop ecx
			>  ret
			[J] Machine Code:
			> 59 59 c3
			[J] Opcode sequence found at: 0x004012f9

	3. Mushishi (Anti-debugging detection / removal)
		a. Not much in here now, but growing
		b. !mushishi detect - detects several methods
		c. !mushishi defeat - defeats known defeatable methods
