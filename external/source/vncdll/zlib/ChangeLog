Changes in 1.1.4 (11 March 2002)
- ZFREE was repeated on same allocation on some error conditions.
  This creates a security problem described in
  http://www.zlib.org/advisory-2002-03-11.txt
- Returned incorrect error (Z_MEM_ERROR) on some invalid data
- Avoid accesses before window for invalid distances with inflate window
  less than 32K.
- force windowBits > 8 to avoid a bug in the encoder for a window size
  of 256 bytes. (A complete fix will be available in 1.1.5).

- Eliminate memory leaks on error conditions in inflate
- Removed some vestigial code in inflate
- Update web address in README
  
Changes in 1.0.4 (24 Jul 96)
- In very rare conditions, deflate(s, Z_FINISH) could fail to produce an EOF
  bit, so the decompressor could decompress all the correct data but went
  on to attempt decompressing extra garbage data. This affected minigzip too.

Changes in 1.0.3 (2 Jul 96)

  small and medium models; this makes the library incompatible with previous
  versions for these models. (No effect in large model or on other systems.)
- return OK instead of BUF_ERROR if previous deflate call returned with
  avail_out as zero but there is nothing to do
- added memcmp for non STDC compilers

- free in reverse order of allocation to help memory manager
- use zlib-1.0/* instead of zlib/* inside the tar.gz
- make zlib warning-free with "gcc -O3 -Wall -Wwrite-strings -Wpointer-arith
  -Wconversion -Wstrict-prototypes -Wmissing-prototypes"

- faster crc32()

Changes in 0.8 (29 April 95)
- added fast inflate (inffast.c)
- deflate(Z_FINISH) now returns Z_STREAM_END when done. Warning: this
  is incompatible with previous versions of zlib which returned Z_OK.

  (actually that was not a compiler bug, see 0.81 above)
- gzread no longer reads one extra byte in certain cases
- In gzio destroy(), don't reference a freed structure
- avoid many warnings for MSDOS

  TurboC large model.

Changes in 0.7 (14 April 95)
- Added full inflate support.
- Simplified the crc32() interface. The pre- and post-conditioning
