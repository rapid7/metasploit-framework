There are two programs here in the two subdirectories:

	vncviewer - this is the VNC viewer, or client, program for Win32.

	winvnc - this is the VNC server for Win32. It allows an NT desktop
	       to be accessed remotely using a VNC viewer.

The executables can be built using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0.
See BUILDING.txt files for more details on compilation.
