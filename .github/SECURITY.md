# Reporting security issues

Thanks for your interest in making Metasploit more secure! If you feel
that you have found a security issue involving Metasploit, Meterpreter,
Recog, or any other Rapid7 open source project, you are welcome to let
us know in the way that's most comfortable for you.

## Via ZenDesk

You can click on the big blue button at [Rapid7's Vulnerability
Disclosure][r7-vulns] page, which will get you to our general
vulnerability reporting system. While this does require a (free) ZenDesk
account to use, you'll get regular updates on your issue as our software
support teams work through it. As it happens [that page][r7-vulns] also
will tell you what to expect when it comes to reporting vulns, how fast
we'll fix and respond, and all the rest, so it's a pretty good read
regardless.

## Via email

If you're more of a traditionalist, you can email your finding to
security@rapid7.com. If you like, you can use our [PGP key][pgp] to
encrypt your messages, but we certainly don't mind cleartext reports
over email.

## NOT via GitHub Issues

Please don't! Disclosing security vulnerabilities to public bug trackers
is kind of mean, even when it's well-intentioned, since you end up
dropping 0-day on pretty much everyone right out of the gate. We'd prefer
you didn't!
