                    Thanks for your contribution to Metasploit Framework! We've looked at this pull request, and we agree that it seems like a good addition to Metasploit, but it looks like it is not quite ready to land. We've labeled it \`attic\` and closed it for now.

                    What does this generally mean? It could be one or more of several things:

                      - It doesn't look like there has been any activity on this pull request in a while
                      - We may not have the proper access or equipment to test this pull request, or the contributor doesn't have time to work on it right now.
                      - Sometimes the implementation isn't quite right and a different approach is necessary.

                    We would love to land this pull request when it's ready. If you have a chance to address all comments, we would be happy to reopen and discuss how to merge this!

                    Thanks for your pull request! Before this can be merged, we need the following documentation for your module:

                    - [Writing Module Documentation](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/development/quality/writing-module-documentation.html)
                    - [Template](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/documentation/modules/module_doc_template.md)
                    - [Examples](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/tree/master/documentation/modules)

                    Thanks for your pull request! Before this pull request can be merged, it must pass the checks of our automated linting tools.

                    We use Rubocop and msftidy to ensure the quality of our code. This can be ran from the root directory of Metasploit:

                    \`\`\`
                    rubocop <directory or file>
                    tools/dev/msftidy.rb <directory or file>
                    \`\`\`

                    You can automate most of these changes with the \`-a\` flag:

                    \`\`\`
                    rubocop -a <directory or file>
                    \`\`\`

                    Please update your branch after these have been made, and reach out if you have any problems.

                    Thanks for your pull request! We require for all contributed code to come from a **from a unique branch** in your repository before it can be merged.

                    Please create a new branch in your fork of framework and resubmit this from that branch.

                    If you are using Git on the command line that may look like:

                    \`\`\`
                    # Checkout the master branch
                    git checkout master

                    # Create a new branch for your feature
                    git checkout -b <BRANCH_NAME>

                    # Add your new files
                    git add modules/my-cool-new-module

                    # Commit your changes with a relevant message
                    git commit

                    # Push your changes to GitHub
                    git push origin <BRANCH_NAME>

                    # Now browse to the following URL and create your pull request!
                    # - https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pulls
                    \`\`\`

                    This helps protect the process, ensure users are aware of commits on the branch being considered for merge, allows for a location for more commits to be offered without mingling with other contributor changes and allows contributors to make progress while a PR is still being reviewed.

                    Please do resubmit from a unique branch, we greatly value your contribution! :tada:

                    Thanks for your pull request! As part of our landing process, we manually verify that all modules work as expected.

                    We have been unable to test this module successfully. This may be due to software or hardware requirements we cannot replicate.

                    To help unblock this pull request, please:

                    - Comment with links to documentation on how to set up an environment, and provide exact software version numbers to use
                    - Or comment guided steps on how to set up our environment for testing this module
                    - Or send pcaps/screenshots/recordings of it working - you can email us msfdev[at]rapid7.com

                    Once there's a clear path for testing and evaluating this module, we can progress with this further.
