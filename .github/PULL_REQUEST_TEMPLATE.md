If you are opening a PR for a new module that exploits a **specific** piece of hardware or requires a **complex or hard-to-find** testing environment, we recommend that you send us a demo of your module executing correctly. Seeing your module in action will help us review your PR faster!

Specific Hardware Examples:
* Switches
* Routers
* IP Cameras
* IoT devices

Complex Software Examples:
* Expensive proprietary software
* Software with an extensive installation process
* Software that requires exploit testing across multiple significantly different versions
* Software without an English language UI

We will also accept demonstrations of successful module execution even if your module doesn't meet the above conditions. It's not a necessity, but it may help us land your module faster!

Demonstration of successful module execution can take the form of a packet capture (pcap) or a screen recording. You can send pcaps and recordings to [msfdev@metasploit.com](mailto:msfdev@metasploit.com). Please include a CVE number in the subject header (if applicable), and a link to your PR in the email body.
If you wish to sanitize your pcap, please see the [wiki](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/development/get-started/sanitizing-pcaps.html).
