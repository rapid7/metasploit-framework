The [HttpClient mixin](https://docs.metasploit.com/api/Msf/Exploit/Remote/HttpClient) can be included with an exploit module in order to facilitate easier HTTP communications with a target machine.

## There are mainly two common methods you will see:

* **[send\_request\_raw](https://docs.metasploit.com/api/Msf/Exploit/Remote/HttpClient.html#send_request_raw-instance_method)** - You use this to send a raw HTTP request. Usually, you will want this method if you need something that violates the specification; in most other cases, you should prefer `send_request_cgi`.  If you wish to learn about how this method works, look at the documentation for [`Rex::Proto::Http::Client#request_raw`](https://docs.metasploit.com/api/Rex/Proto/Http/Client.html#request_raw-instance_method).

Here's a basic example of how to use `send_request_raw`:

```ruby
	send_request_raw({'uri'=>'/index.php'})
```

* **[send\_request\_cgi](https://docs.metasploit.com/api/Msf/Exploit/Remote/HttpClient.html#send_request_cgi-instance_method)** - You use this to send a more CGI-compatible HTTP request. If your request contains a query string (or POST data), then you should use this.  If you wish to learn about how this method works, check out [`Rex::Proto::Http::Client#request_cgi`](https://docs.metasploit.com/api/Rex/Proto/Http/Client.html#request_cgi-instance_method).



Here's a very basic example for `send_request_cgi`:

```ruby
send_request_cgi({
  'method' => 'GET',
  'uri' => '/hello_world.php',
  'vars_get' => {
    'param_1' => 'abc',
    'param_2' => '123'
  }
})
```

**Please note**: `send_request_raw` and `send_request_cgi` will return a `nil` if there's a timeout, so please make sure to account for that condition when you handle the return value.

## Cookies & CookieJars

Part of send\_request\_cgi functionality is the ability to collect, edit, and send cookies via the HttpClient's  `cookie_jar` variable, an instance of the [HttpCookieJar](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/lib/msf/core/exploit/remote/http/http_cookie_jar.rb) class.

A HttpCookieJar is a collection of [HttpCookie](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/lib/msf/core/exploit/remote/http/http_cookie.rb). The Jar can be populated manually with it's `add` method, or automatically via the `keep_cookies` option that can be passed to [send\_request\_cgi](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/92d981fff2b4a40324969fd1d1744219589b5fa3/lib/msf/core/exploit/remote/http_client.rb#L385).

If you need to clear the cookie jar (for instance, using a 2nd login), try:

```ruby
cookie_jar.clear
```

### `keep_cookies` option

Shown below is the request used to login to a gitlab account in the [gitlab\_file\_read\_rce exploit module](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/92d981fff2b4a40324969fd1d1744219589b5fa3/modules/exploits/multi/http/gitlab_file_read_rce.rb#L70)

```ruby
res = @http_client.send_request_cgi({
  'method' => 'POST',
  'uri' => '/users/sign_in',
  'keep_cookies' => true,
  'vars_post' => {
    'utf8' => 'âœ“',
    'authenticity_token' => csrf_token,
    'user[login]' => username,
    'user[password]' => password,
    'user[remember_me]' => 0
  }
})
```
The cookies returned by the server with a successful login need to be attached to all future requests, so `'keep_cookies' => true,` is used to add all returned cookies to the HttpClient CookieJar and attach them to all subsequent requests.

### `cookie` option
Shown below is the request used to login to a gitlab account in the [artica\_proxy\_auth\_bypass\_service\_cmds\_peform\_command\_injection module](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/92d981fff2b4a40324969fd1d1744219589b5fa3/modules/exploits/linux/http/artica_proxy_auth_bypass_service_cmds_peform_command_injection.rb#L115)

artica\_proxy\_auth\_bypass\_service\_cmds\_peform\_command\_injection requires a specific cookie header to be sent with a request in order to achieve RCE. By setting a string of the desired header as the value of the `cookie` option, that string is set as the cookie header without any changes, allowing the exploit to be carried out.

```ruby
res = send_request_cgi({
  'method' => 'GET',
  'uri' => normalize_uri(target_uri.path, 'cyrus.index.php'),
  'vars_get' => {
    'service-cmds-peform' => "||#{Rex::Text.uri_encode(cmd, 'hex-all')}||"
  },
  'cookie' => "PHPSESSID=#{@phpsessid}; AsWebStatisticsCooKie=1; shellinaboxCooKie=1"
})
```

Any object passed to `cookie` that isn't an instance of HttpCookieJar will have `to_s` called on it. The result of `to_s` will be set as the cookie header of the http request. The contents of the HttpClient cookie\_jar is ignored **_only_** this request. Subsequent requests are unaffected.

----

Module authors can also pass an instance of `HttpCookieJar` with the `cookie` option:

```ruby
cj = Msf::Exploit::Remote::HTTP::HttpCookieJar.new

cj.add(Msf::Exploit::Remote::HTTP::HttpCookie.new('PHPSESSID', @phpsessid))
cj.add(Msf::Exploit::Remote::HTTP::HttpCookie.new('AsWebStatisticsCooKie', 1))
cj.add(Msf::Exploit::Remote::HTTP::HttpCookie.new('shellinaboxCooKie', 1))

res = send_request_cgi({
  'method' => 'GET',
  'uri' => normalize_uri(target_uri.path, 'cyrus.index.php'),
  'vars_get' => {
    'service-cmds-peform' => "||#{Rex::Text.uri_encode(cmd, 'hex-all')}||"
  },
  'cookie' => cj
})
```
The above code would create an identical cookie header to the one used in the previous example, save for a random ordering of the name value pairs. This shouldn't affect how the server would read the cookies, but it's still worth keeping in mind if you've somehow found a vuln reliant on the order of cookies in a header.

### expire_cookies

`send_request_cgi` will call `cleanup` on `cookie_jar` before iot is used to populate a request with cookies. `cleanup` will remove any expired cookies permenetly from the jar, affecting all future requests.

If this behaviour isn't deisred and an author would prefer to keep expired cookies in the jar, the `expire_cookies` option can be set to false:

```ruby
res = send_request_cgi({
  'method' => 'GET',
  'uri' => normalize_uri(target_uri.path, 'cyrus.index.php'),
  'vars_get' => {
    'service-cmds-peform' => "||#{Rex::Text.uri_encode(cmd, 'hex-all')}||"
  },
  'cookie' => "PHPSESSID=#{@phpsessid}; AsWebStatisticsCooKie=1; shellinaboxCooKie=1",
  'expire_cookies' => false
})
```


## URI Parsing

Before you send a HTTP request, you will most likely have to do some URI parsing.  This is a tricky task, because sometimes when you join paths, you may accidentally get double slashes, like this: "/test//index.php".  Or for some reason you have a missing slash.  These are really commonly made mistakes.  So here's how you can handle it safely:

**1** - Register your default URI datastore option as 'TARGETURI':

Example:

```ruby
register_options(
  [
    OptString.new('TARGETURI', [true, 'The base path to XXX application', '/xxx_v1/'])
  ]
)
```

**2** - Load your TARGETURI with [`target_uri`](https://docs.metasploit.com/api/Msf/Exploit/Remote/HttpClient.html#target_uri-instance_method), that way the URI input validation will kick in, and then you get a real `URI` object:

In this example, we'll just load the path:

```ruby
uri = target_uri.path
```

**3** - When you want to join another URI, always use [`normalize_uri`](https://docs.metasploit.com/api/Msf/Exploit/Remote/HttpClient.html#normalize_uri-instance_method):

Example:

```ruby
# Returns: "/xxx_v1/admin/upload.php"
uri = normalize_uri(uri, 'admin', 'upload.php')
```

**4** - When you're done normalizing the URI, you're ready to use `send_request_cgi` or `send_request_raw`

Please note: The `normalize_uri` method will always follow these rules:

1. The URI should always begin with a slash.
2. You will have to decide if you need the trailing slash or not.
3. There should be no double slashes.

## Full Example

```ruby
class MetasploitModule < Msf::Auxiliary

  include Msf::Exploit::Remote::HttpClient

  def initialize(info = {})
    super(
      update_info(
        info,
        'Name' => 'HttpClient Example',
        'Description' => %q{
          Do a send_request_cgi()
        },
        'Author' => [ 'sinn3r' ],
        'License' => MSF_LICENSE
      )
    )

    register_options(
      [
        OptString.new('TARGETURI', [true, 'The base path', '/'])
      ]
    )
  end

  def run
    uri = target_uri.path

    res = send_request_cgi({
      'method' => 'GET',
      'uri' => normalize_uri(uri, 'admin', 'index.php'),
      'vars_get' => {
        'p1' => 'This is param 1',
        'p2' => 'This is param 2'
      }
    })

    if res && res.code == 200
      print_good('I got a 200, awesome')
    else
      print_error('No 200, feeling blue')
    end
  end
end

```

## Working with Burp Suite

Burp Suite is a useful tool to examine or modify HTTPS traffic while developing a module using HttpClient. To do this:

1. Start Burp: ```java -jar burpsuite.jar```
2. In Burp, click on the Proxies tab, and then Options. Configure the proxy listener there. In this example, let's say we have a listener on port 6666.
3. Once the Burp listener is up, start msfconsole and load the module you're working on.
4. Enter: ```set Proxies HTTP:127.0.0.1:6666```
5. Go ahead and run the module, Burp should intercept the HTTPS traffic.

Note that Burp only supports HTTPS for HttpClient. This problem is only specific to Burp and Metasploit.

If you need to examine HTTP traffic for HttpClient, a workaround is adding the following method in your module. This will override HttpClient's send_request_* method, and return the modified output:

```ruby
def send_request_cgi(opts)
  res = super(opts)
  puts res.request.to_s
  puts
  puts res.to_s
  puts
  puts
end
```

You can do the same for send_request_raw as well.

## Other Common questions:

**1 - Can I use ```vars_get``` and ```vars_post``` together?**

Yes. When you supply a hash to ```vars_get```, basically it means "put all this data in the query string". When you supply a hash to ```vars_post```, it means "put all this data in the body." All of them will be in the same request. You do need to make sure you're using ```send_request_cgi```, of course.

**2 - I can't use ```vars_get``` or ```vars_post``` due to some weird reason, what to do?**

Do mention about this problem in the code (as a comment). If you can't use ```vars_post```, you can try the ```data``` key instead, which will send your post data raw. Normally, the most common solution to get around ```vars_get``` is to leave your stuff in the ```uri``` key. msftidy will flag this, but only as an "Info" and not a warning, which means you should still pass msftidy anyway. If this is a common problem, we can always change msftidy.

**3 - Do I need to manually do basic auth?**

You do not need to manually do basic auth in your request, because HttpClient should automatically do that for you. All you have to do is set the username and password in the datastore options, and then the mixin will use that when the web server asks.

**4 - How do I send a MIME request?**

See [Rex::MIME::Message](https://github.com/rapid7/rex-mime/blob/master/lib/rex/mime/message.rb)
