# Chat

A lot of our discussion happens on IRC in #metasploit on Freenode.
Please be patient and hang around for a while -- not everyone is awake
at the same time as you. =)

# Mailing list

The Metasploit development mailing list used to be hosted on SourceForge, but is now on Google Groups. Metasploit Hackers is dead, long live [Metasploit Hackers][list]. (Or [mailto:Metasploit Hackers][mailto]).

The old list [is archived on seclists.org][archive].
