Welcome to Metasploit-land. Are you a Metasploit user who wants to get started or get better at hacking stuff (that you have permission to hack)? The quickest way to get started is to [[download the Metasploit nightly installers|./Nightly-Installers.md]]. This will give you access to both the free, open-source Metasploit Framework and a free trial of Metasploit Pro.

If you're using [Kali Linux](https://kali.org/), Metasploit is already pre-installed. See the [Kali documentation](https://kali.org/docs/tools/starting-metasploit-framework-in-kali/) for how to get started using Metasploit in Kali Linux.

Are you anxious to get your [[Metasploit Development Environment|./dev/Setting-Up-a-Metasploit-Development-Environment.md]] set up so you can start [[Landing Pull Requests]] and contributing excellent exploit code? If so, you're in the right place. If you're an exploit developer, you will want to review our [[Guidelines for Accepting Modules and Enhancements]] to find out what we expect when we see pull requests for new Metasploit modules. No idea what you should start working on? Check out the guidelines for [[contributing to Metasploit]], and dive into [[Setting Up a Metasploit Development Environment]].
