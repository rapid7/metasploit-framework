# Signing criteria

In order to get @todb-r7 to sign your key, you should

a) tell him your Key ID over some mechanism (IRC, Skype, etc
b) post it to https://gist.github.com under your GitHub account.

If you are near by, he'll ask you to confirm your KeyID in meatspace, using unique biometric and contextual data to verify your identity. If not, he'll e-mail you, using that key and a known e-mail address, and expect your response.

This constitutes verification that your key is, in fact, yours. Please set a reasonable expiration date (18 months is recommended), key length (2048 or better), and use good sense when managing your private key availability.
