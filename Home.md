Welcome to Metasploit-land. 

Are you a Metasploit user who wants to get started or get better at hacking stuff (that you have permission to hack)? The quickest way to get started is to [download the Metasploit binary installer](http://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit/download.jsp). This will give you access to both the free, open-source Metasploit Framework and a free trial of Metasploit Pro.

If you're using [Kali Linux](http://kali.org), Metasploit is already pre-installed. See the [Kali documentation](http://docs.kali.org/general-use/starting-metasploit-framework-in-kali) for how to get started using Metasploit in Kali Linux.

Are you anxious to get your [Metasploit Development Environment](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Setting-Up-a-Metasploit-Development-Environment) set up so you can start [[Landing Pull Requests]] and contributing excellent exploit code? If so, you're in the right place. If you're an exploit developer, you will want to review our [[Guidelines for Accepting Modules and Enhancements]] to find out what we expect when we see pull requests for new Metasploit modules. No idea what you should start working on? Check out the guidelines for [[contributing to Metasploit]], and dive into [[Setting Up a Metasploit Development Environment]].
