This goal of this project is to provide a consistent interface 
to LBL's libpcap packet capture library. 

== Limitations

This does not provide packet processing functionality, it simply provides 
the interface for capturing packets, and passing yielding those packets. 

For packet processing capability look at ruby gems PCAPFU, PCAPLET, etc..

== Requirements

MRI POSIX Ruby (Native compilation) [Travis-CI Tested]
  Ruby 1.8.7  (EOL June 2014)
  Ruby 1.9.3
  ~> Ruby 2.x 

  libpcap - http://www.tcpdump.org

Ruby with DevKit(32bit) on Windows [AppVeyor Tested]
  Ruby 1.9.3
  ~> Ruby 2.x
  
  WinPcap Developer's Pack - http://www.winpcap.org
  
== Installation  

  gem install pcaprub
  
Advanced options in a Windows ENV
  
  gem install pcaprub --no-ri --no-rdoc -- --with-pcap-dir="c:/dev/src/WpdPack"

== Usage

 require 'rubygems'
 require 'pcaprub'
 
 cap = PCAPRUB::Pcap.new

== Current Repository for Gemcutter source

The Git Repo on Github @pcaprub is forked from the Metasploit SVN repo
  git clone git://github.com/pcaprub/pcaprub.git

== Additionals

=== Notes on 0.11.x series and beyond.

The gem is now a module. The module is autoincluded, but this helps with name collisions and additional growth.

Some of the Error handling and basic intensive code is moving out the C base-extension (ext) and into native Ruby.

The file handling in dumper is now attached to the Capture Class and not the Module as an additional singleton.

  capture = PCAPRUB::Pcap.open_live('eth0', SNAPLENGTH, true, 0)
  capture.dump_open('./Example.pcap') 
    { ... }
  capture.dump_close
  
=== Timstamps from the PCAP Header 

Timestamps are now available when yeilding packets instead of strings

  capture = PCAPRUB::Pcap.open_live('eth0', SNAPLENGTH, true, 0)
  capture.each_packet do |packet|
    puts Time.at(packet.time)
    puts "micro => #{packet.microsec}"
  end
    
=== Ruby 1.8.7 & WinPcap

On Ruby 1.8 with winpcap, rb_thread_polling pauses for 100 milliseconds between reads. This may mean some packets are missed.
