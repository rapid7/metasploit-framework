== Version 2.0.0 - December 5th, 2010

Change of major version because of two small changes that are not quite compatible and because the minor version was getting quite high!

* Remove attempt at faking the new method missing. Unless you used `respond_to_missing` *and* `method(:some_method_handled_with_method_missing)`, you won't see a difference, except better performance (see issue #32) and this fixes some errors (see issue #34)

* Change behavior of array.flatten(0) to match Ruby 1.9 (i.e. return a dup of array, instead of array itself)

* Finer grain includes (see README)
  require "backports/1.9"    # requires all ruby backports
  require "backports/1.9.1"  # requires all ruby backports up to 1.9.1 (but not 1.9.2)

* Backported all builtin methods of 1.8.8 (most of which where moved from the 1.9 backports)

File#to_path is also an alias to File#path. These have been backported.

* File.binread (actually IO.binread)

* BasicObject available via "require 'backports/basic_object"

== Version 1.8.4 - September 3rd, 2009

Added Dir.mktmpdir for older version of 1.8.6

== Version 1.8.1 - September 1st, 2009

Added the alias String#lines (Ruby 1.8.7)

Backports can be required selectively:
* backports/1.8.7
* backports/1.9 (which include 1.8.7)
* rails

== Version 1.8 - August 30, 2009

Backports can be required selectively:
* backports/1.8.7
* backports/1.9 (which include 1.8.7)
* rails

== Version 1.7.1 - August 20, 2009

Enumerable#take and Enumerable#first(n) are now returning as soon as possible. Previously, #each was yielding one element too many. See redmine issue #1554.

== Version 1.7 - May 27, 2009

Porting all 1.8.7 features to rubinius was quite enlightening (http://blog.marc-andre.ca/2009/05/schizo-ruby-puzzle.html ).
Many improvements were made to be consistent with MRI, e.g. converting arguments using to_int if needed, etc...
The changes are now reflected in 'backports'.

Some IO and ARGF methods were missing and are now complete.

== Version 1.6.6 - April 30, 2009

Important bug fix. String#gsub is left alone until I find a good way to modify it.

== Version 1.6 - April 29, 2009

Completed backport to 1.8.7.
