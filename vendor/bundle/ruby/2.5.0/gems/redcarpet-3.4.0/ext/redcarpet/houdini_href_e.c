 * The following characters will not be escaped:

 *
 * Note that this character set is the addition of:
 *
 *	- The characters which are safe to be in an URL
 *	- The characters which are *not* safe to be in
 *	an URL because they are RESERVED characters.
 *
 * We asume (lazily) that any RESERVED char that
 * appears inside an URL is actually meant to
 * have its native function (i.e. as an URL 
 * component/separator) and hence needs no escaping.
 *
 * There is one exception: the ' (single quote) 
 * character does not appear in the table.
 * It is meant to appear in the URL as components,
 * however it require special HTML-entity escaping
 * to generate valid HTML markup.
 *
 * All other characters will be escaped to %XX.
