     On Heroku, when shutting down a process, we send a SIGTERM followed 10
     seconds later with a SIGKILL, similar to the behavior of the init daemon
     on most Unix systems. This patch will allow Heroku apps to shut down
     gracefully when they need to be terminated / moved.

== 1.2.8 Black Keys
 * Allow the connection to remain open for 1xx statuses [timshadel]

     Both the 100 and 101 status codes require that the connection to the
     server remain open. The 100 status code is used to tell the client that
     the server is still receiving its request, and will continue to read
     request input on the connection. The 101 status code is used to upgrade
     the existing connection to another protocol, and specifically is NOT
     used to upgrade a separate connection. Therefore, the connection must
     remain open after this response in order to facilitate that.

       server   unix:/tmp/thin.1.sock;
       server   unix:/tmp/thin.2.sock;
     }

   Start your servers like this:

     thin start -s3 -S/tmp/thin.sock

 * Remove Server#listen! method. Use Server#start instead.
