bit-struct 0.16

- updated for ruby 2.4

bit-struct 0.15

- modernize rakefile and gemspec
- switch to minitest

bit-struct 0.14

- updated for ruby 2.0

bit-struct 0.13.6

- Fixed bug in #to_a. Thanks Michael Edgar.

bit-struct 0.13

- Packaged as a gem using bones.

- Added nest fields defined with blocks. (Markus Fischer)

- Vector length may be specified as argument or :length option. (Markus Fischer)

bit-struct 0.12

- Added vectors.

- BitStruct#initialize can take an IO argument.

bit-struct 0.11

- Allow unaligned fields to cross up to two byte boundaries.
  See examples/byte-bdy.rb.

bit-struct 0.10

- Fixed a bug when calling #to_yaml on a BitStruct with a pad field. Thanks
  to Jay Reitz for reporting it and providing the solution.

- Added BitStruct.default_options. Particularly useful for default endian
  settings--see examples/native.rb.

- Fixed a bug that prevented warning about field name conflicts with
  existing methods when the name is given as a symbol.

- Fixed point fields may now have fractional divisors (like :fixed => 0.001).

bit-struct 0.9

- Added examples/field-ripper.rb.

- Added BitStruct#field_by_name.

- Added more warnings about nested field accessors returning a *copy* of the
  nested data.

- Added "pad" fields. See documentation in pad-field.rb and examples/pad.rb.

- The #initial_value method now yields the value to a block, if given.

- A BitStruct class is only closed when an instance is created. (After this
  point no fields can be added.) Formerly, a class was closed when any method
  requested the total length of the structure. This change makes it easier
  to add groups of fields modularly, each with their own initial_value block.

- Added examples/modular-def.rb to explain how to factor a BitStruct
  definition into modules.

bit-struct 0.8

- Signed fields can now (like unsigned fields) be any multiple of 8 bits, and are accessed as fixnums or bignums, as needed.

- It's easier to subclass BitStruct::OctetField. BitStruct::HexOctetField is now implemented in this way, just by defining three constants and two trivial class methods.

bit-struct 0.7

- BitStruct.describe now takes an option hash, and the :expand=>true option causes nested fields to be expanded in the description.

- Unsigned integer fields can now be any multiple of 8 bytes: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, ... (Fields of 1..15 bits in length are of course still supported.)

- Added the :endian => :little option to signed integer, unsigned integer, and float fields. The full set of endian options is now [:little, :big, :network, :native]. The default is always :network.

- Option names may be strings or symbols. Values that can be symbols can also be strings.

- Added examples/bignum.rb.

- Added support for the YAML in ruby 1.8.2 (the YAML in 1.8.4 was already supported).

bit-struct 0.6

- Added the :endian => :native option for numerical fields (signed, unsigned, float).

- Fixed error message with 9..15 bit fields aligned on byte boundary.

- The #initial_value is now inherited (before applying defaults).

- New examples: raw.rb, native.rb.

bit-struct 0.5

- Integer fields may now cross byte boundaries, as long as the field fits within two whole bytes.

bit-struct 0.4

- Fixed a bug in reading text and char fields in YAML: if the value was interpreted by YAML as something other than a string, an error would result.

- When BitStructs are loaded from yaml, the key is treated as a setter method, rather than a field. This is useful in case there is a field that needs special setters to accept humanly readable input. (For example, a char field with length-prefixed subfields.)

bit-struct 0.3

- BitStruct classes are now YAML friendly.

- The default behavior of BitStruct#inspect and BitStruct#inspect_detailed is changed to print out the "rest" field, if any. This can be disabled by passing inspect an options hash with :include_rest => false. See BitStruct::DEFAULT_INSPECT_OPTS and BitStruct::DETAILED_INSPECT_OPTS. See examples/ip.rb and examples/rest.rb.

- The default behavior of BitStruct#to_h is changed to include the "rest" field. As above, this can be disabled by passing to_h an options hash with :include_rest => false.

- The default behavior of BitStruct#to_a is changed to include the "rest" field. As above, this can be disabled by passing false as an argument to to_a.
