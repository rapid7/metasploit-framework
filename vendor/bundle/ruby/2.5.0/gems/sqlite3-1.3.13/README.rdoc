== DESCRIPTION

This module allows Ruby programs to interface with the SQLite3
database engine (http://www.sqlite.org).  You must have the
SQLite engine installed in order to build this module.

Note that this module is only compatible with SQLite 3.6.16 or newer.

== SYNOPSIS

  require "sqlite3"
  
  # Open a database
  db = SQLite3::Database.new "test.db"
  
  # Create a table
  rows = db.execute <<-SQL
    create table numbers (
      name varchar(30),
      val int
    );
  SQL
  
  # Execute a few inserts
  {
    "one" => 1,
    "two" => 2,
  }.each do |pair|
    db.execute "insert into numbers values ( ?, ? )", pair
  end

  # Find a few rows
  db.execute( "select * from numbers" ) do |row|
    p row
  end

  # Create another table with multiple columns

  db.execute <<-SQL
    create table students (
      name varchar(50),
      email varchar(50),
      grade varchar(5),
      blog varchar(50)
    );
  SQL

  # Execute inserts with parameter markers
  db.execute("INSERT INTO students (name, email, grade, blog) 
              VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)", ["Jane", "me@janedoe.com", "A", "http://blog.janedoe.com"])
  
  db.execute( "select * from students" ) do |row|
    p row
  end


== Compilation and Installation

Install SQLite3, enabling the option SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA (see
www.sqlite.org/compile.html for details).

Then do the following:

  ruby setup.rb config
  ruby setup.rb setup
  ruby setup.rb install

Alternatively, you can download and install the RubyGem package for
SQLite3/Ruby (you must have RubyGems and SQLite3 installed, first):

  gem install sqlite3

If you have sqlite3 installed in a non-standard location, you can specify the location of the include and lib files by doing:

  gem install sqlite3 -- --with-sqlite3-include=/opt/local/include \
     --with-sqlite3-lib=/opt/local/lib
