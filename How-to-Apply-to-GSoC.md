**Note:** Final project proposals must be submitted through to Google through the GSoC Program Website, as stated in the [rules](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules/).

Before submitting to the GSoC website, it is also helpful to solicit proposal feedback via one of the contact methods found on https://metasploit.com/contribute. If you don't hear back right away on a proposal, don't give up! Contributors may be busy, or you may need to try again to get someone's attention (but don't spam).
 
When making your proposal, please include:

## Title

A brief description of what you would like to work on. See [[GSoC-2020-Project-Ideas]] for ideas.

## Vitals

* Your name
* Contact info - include at least:
  - an email address
  - github user name
  - Freenode nick

## Skillz

What programming languages are you familiar with, in order of proficiency? Most of Metasploit is written in Ruby; for any project you will most likely need at least a passing knowledge of it. If you want to work on Meterpreter or Mettle, C will be necessary as well. 

What other projects have you worked on before?
