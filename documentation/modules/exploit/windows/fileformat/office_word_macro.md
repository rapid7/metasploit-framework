## Description

This module generates a macro-enabled Microsoft Office Word document. It does not target a specific
CVE or vulnerability, this is more of a feature-abuse in Office, however this type of
social-engineering attack still remains common today.

There are many ways to create this type of malicious doc. The module injects the Base64-encoded
payload in the comments field, which will get decoded back by the macro and executed as a Windows
executable when the Office document is launched.

Please note: By default, Microsoft Office does not execute macros automatically. If a macro is
present, the user will most likely need to manually click on the "Enable Content" button in order
to run the macro.


## Vulnerable Application

A Windows machine with Microsoft Office installed. The Office application must support the docm
format.

Specifically, this module was tested specifically against:

* Microsoft Office 2010.
* Microsoft Office 2013.

## Verification Steps

1. ```use exploit/windows/fileformat/office_word_macro```
2. ```set PAYLOAD [PAYLOAD NAME]```
3. Configure the rest of the settings accordingly (BODY, LHOST, LPORT, etc)
4. ```exploit```
5. The module should generate the malicious docm.

## Options

**BODY** Text to put in the Office document. See **Modification** below if you wish to modify more.

## Modification

To use this exploit in a real environment, you will most likely need to modify the docm content.
Here's one approach you can do:

1. Use the module to generate the malicious docm
2. Copy the malicious docm to a Windows machine, and edit it with Microsoft Office (such as 2013).
   When you open the document, the payload will probably do something on your machine. It's ok,
   since you generated it, it should not cause any problems for you.
3. Save the doc, and test again to make sure the payload still works.

While editing, you should avoid modifying the following unless you are an advanced user:

* The comments field. If you have to modify this, make sure to create 55 empty spaces
  in front of the payload string. The blank space is for making the payload less obvious
  at first sight if the user views the file properties.
* The VB code in the macro.
