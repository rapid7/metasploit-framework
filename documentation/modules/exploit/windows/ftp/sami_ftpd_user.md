## Vulnerable Application

This module exploits an unauthenticated stack buffer overflow in
KarjaSoft Sami FTP Server version 2.0.2 by sending an overly long
USER string during login.

The payload is triggered when the administrator opens the application
GUI. If the GUI window is open at the time of exploitation, the
payload will be executed immediately. Keep this in mind when selecting
payloads. The application will crash following execution of the
payload and will not restart automatically.

When the application is restarted, it will re-execute the payload
unless the payload has been manually removed from the SamiFTP.binlog
log file.

This module has been tested successfully on Sami FTP Server versions:

* 2.0.2 on Windows XP SP0 (x86)
* 2.0.2 on Windows 7 SP1 (x86)
* 2.0.2 on Windows 7 SP1 (x64)
* 2.0.2 on Windows 10 (1909) (x64)
