This module attempts to exploit existing administrative privileges to obtain a SYSTEM session. If directly creating a
service fails, this module will inspect existing services to look for insecure configuration, file or registry
permissions that may be hijacked. It will then attempt to restart the replaced service to run the payload. This will
result in a new session when this succeeds.

## Escalation Techniques
This module attempts the following techniques to execute a payload as SYSTEM. All techniques involve writing artifacts
to disk on the target system.

### Technique: New Service Creation
The module will attempt to create a new service. This generally will not work unless the session is running as a user
with elevated privileges (such as Local Administrator) that are sufficient to create new services.

### Technique: Weak Service Permissions
The module will attempt to make changes to an existing service. This enumerates existing services and checks for the
permissions to edit each one. When one is found, the service is updated to execute a payload.

### Technique: Weak File System Permissions
The module will examine the file system permissions of the executable associated with each existing service. If one is
found where the user has write access, the module will leverage it to execute a payload in place of the original service
executable.

### Technique: Weak Registry Permissions
The module will check the permissions on each service's respective registry entries. It will then attempt to create a
`Performance` key where it can add values necessary to force a DLL to be loaded. Once completed, a WMI query is executed
to trigger the payload. This technique was originally discovered by ClÃ©ment Labro and disclosed in the blog [Windows
RpcEptMapper Service Insecure Registry Permissions EoP](https://itm4n.github.io/windows-registry-rpceptmapper-eop/) on
November 12th, 2020.

**This technique notably affects default and fully patched installations of Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2.** Users should
either set the `TargetServiceName` option to `rpceptmapper` or enable the `AGGRESSIVE` option in this case. Without one
of these settings, it's possible the module may find an affected service other than the RpcEptMapper which may not yield
a session with elevated privileges. For an example, see the scenario below.

## Vulnerable Application

This technique is applicable to any version of Windows. A vulnerable installation however typically involves third-party
software that installs a service with insecure permissions. Furthermore, a user with Local Administrator privileges can
leverage this module to escalate to system by creating a new service.

## Verification Steps
Example steps in this format (is also in the PR):

1. Install the application
1. Start msfconsole
1. Do: `use [module path]`
1. Do: `run`
1. You should get a shell.

## Options

### AGGRESSIVE
Exploit as many services as possible (dangerous). When enabled, the module will continue to check for additional
services even after a vulnerable one has been found.

### TargetServiceName
The name of a specific service to target. This can be used to avoid targeting all available services in the case where
the module user wants to target a specific one. When specified, the service name is compared to others in a
case-insensitive manner per the [`CreateServiceA`][CreateServiceA] documentation.

## Actions

### Exploit CVE-2025-21293
Prior to the January 2025 Windows update, users who are apart of the `Network Configuration Operators` group have the
`CreateSubKey` Registry Right under the `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Dnscache\` registry key (which is the
crux of CVE-2025-21293). This allows them to exploit the Weak Registry Permissions technique included in this module
to gain SYSTEM privileges.

However there are a few caveats to this. As mentioned in the original [research paper](https://birkep.github.io/posts/Windows-LPE/)
there is a chance that the session will be established in the context of `nt authority\local service` and not `nt authority\system`.
If this happens, rerun the module.

Also if UAC is enabled, despite having `CreateSubKey` RegistryRight under the
`HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Dnscache\` registry key, Windows will not let you create the registry key as a
non-admin user. In order to exploit CVE-2025-21293, remotely and from Metasploit, you need to disable UAC. This can be
done by running the following command in an elevated command prompt and then rebooting the system:

```
reg add HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v EnableLUA /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
```
