## Introduction
  This module will abuse the SeImperonsate privilege commonly found in 
services due to the requirement to impersonate a client upon 
authentication. As such it is possible to impersonate the SYSTEM account 
and relay its NTLM hash to RPC via DCOM. The DLL will perform a MiTM 
attack at which intercepts the hash and relay responses from RPC to be 
able to establish a handle to a new SYSTEM token. Some caveats : Set 
your target option to match the architecture of your Meterpreter 
session, else it will inject the wrong architecture DLL into the process 
of a seperate architecture. Additionally, after you have established a 
session, you must use incognito to imperonsate the SYSTEM Token.

## Build Instructions
This builds using visual studio 2017 and tools v141.  Attempts
to compile with previous verstions of build tools will succeed but
the resulting binary fails to exploit the vulnerability.

## Usage
  You'll first need to obtain a session on the target system.
  Next, once the module is loaded, one simply needs to set the 
```payload``` and ```session``` options, in addition to architecture.
  
  Your user at which you are trying to exploit must have `SeImpersonate` 
privileges.
  
  The module has a hardcoded timeout of 20 seconds, as the attack may 
not work immediately and take a few seconds to start. Also, check to 
make sure port 6666 is inherently not in use else the exploit will not 
run properly
