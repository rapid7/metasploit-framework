## Intro

  This module will bypass Windows 10 UAC by hijacking a special key in the Registry under
  the current user hive, and inserting a custom command that will get invoked when
  the Windows fodhelper.exe application is launched. It will spawn a second shell that has the UAC
  flag turned off.

  This module modifies a registry key, but cleans up the key once the payload has
  been invoked.

  The module does not require the architecture of the payload to match the OS. If
  specifying EXE::Custom your DLL should call ExitProcess() after starting your
  payload in a separate process.

## Usage

  You'll first need to obtain a session on the target system.  
  Next, once the module is loaded, one simply needs to set the ```payload``` and ```session``` options.
  The module use an hardcoded timeout of 5 seconds during which it expects fodhelper.exe to be launched on the target system.
  On slower system this may be too short, resulting in no session being created. In this case disable the automatic payload handler (`set DISABLEPAYLOADHANDLER true`)
  and manually create a job handler corresponding to the payload.
