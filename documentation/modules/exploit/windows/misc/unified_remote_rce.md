## Vulnerable Application

This module utilizes the Unified Remote remote control protocol to type out and
deploy a payload.  The remote control protocol can be configured to have no passwords,
a group password, or individual user accounts.  If the web page is accessible, the
access control is set to no password for exploitation, then reverted.
If the web page is not accessible, exploitation will be tried blindly.

This module has been successfully tested against version 3.11.0.2483 (50) on Windows 10.

Version 3.11.0.2483 can be downloaded from
[unifiedremote.com](https://www.unifiedremote.com/static/builds/server/windows-x86/2483/ServerSetup-3.11.0.2483.exe)

## Verification Steps

1. Install the application
2. Start msfconsole
3. Do: `use exploit/windows/misc/unified_remote_rce`
4. Set `rhost` and `lhost` as required.
5. Do: `run`
6. You should get a shell.

## Options


### WEBSERVER

The port the web server is running on.  Defaults to `9510`

### CLIENTNAME

The name of the client device to use.  This shows up in the Unified Remote logs. If empty
A random android based name is chosen. Defaults to ``

### SLEEP

The length of time to sleep between each command, this gives the remote program time to process the command on screen.
Defaults to `1` second.

### PATH

This ONLY applies to the pull method.  Where to temporarily store the payload.  Defaults to `c:\\Windows\\Temp\\`

### VISIBLE

If set to `true`, uses a 'standard' method of typing to the screen. If set to `false`
utilizes a 'pro' feature of unified remote to execute a script in the background.
Defaults to `false`
