## Vulnerable Application

Oracle Application Testing Suite (OATS) is a comprehensive, integrated testing solution for web applications, web services, packaged Oracle
applications, and Oracle databases. OATS is part of an application deployed in the WebLogic service on port 8088, which also includes these
tools: Administrator, OpenScript, Oracle Load Testing, and Oracle Test Manager.

In the administrator console, the deployment feature can be abused to upload an arbitrary WAR file, allowing remote code execution under the
context of SYSTEM. Authentication is required.

The following is the exact setup I used to test and analyze the vulnerability:

- Windows Server 2008 R2 x64 (other Windows systems are also supported)
  - .Net Framework 3.5 enabled (from add/remove features)
  - IE ESC (from Server Manager) disabled
  - 8GB of RAM (at least more than 4GB will be used to run OATS)
  - Duel-Core processor
- oats-win64-full-13.3.0.1.262.zip (x86 did not work for me)
- Jdk-7u21-windows-x64.exe
- OracleXE112_Win64.zip (Newer version 18c did not work well for me)
- Firefox (I had to install this because IE on Win2k8 is completely outdated)
- Adobe Flash installed (IE ESC needs to be disabled in order to install this)

For installation instructions, please refer to the Oracle Application Testing Suite Installation Guide.

### Notes

For Oracle Application Testing Suite (OATS), you may use the `auxiliary/gather/oats_downloadservlet_traversal` module to download the server's encrypted
credentials, decrypt them using a third-party tool, and then use this module to gain remote code execution.
