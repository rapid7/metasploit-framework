## Vulnerable Application

Instructions to get the vulnerable application. If applicable, include links to the vulnerable install
files, as well as instructions on installing/configuring the environment if it is different than a
standard install. Much of this will come from the PR, and can be copy/pasted.

## Verification Steps
Example steps in this format (is also in the PR):

1. Install the application
1. Start msfconsole
1. Do: `use [module path]`
1. Do: `run`
1. You should get a shell.
