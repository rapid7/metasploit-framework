## Vulnerable Application

  Any MediaWiki installation with SyntaxHighlight version 2.0 installed & enabled. This extension ships with the AIO package of MediaWiki 1.27.x & 1.28.x. This issue was supposed to be fixed in MediaWiki version 1.28.1 and version 1.27.2. It appears that the fix was pushed to the git repository, but for some reason it was not included in the release packages.

## Verification Steps

  1. `use exploit/multi/http/mediawiki_syntaxhighlight`
  2. `set RHOST <ip target site>`
  3. `set TARGETURI <MediaWiki path>`
  4. `set UPLOADPATH <writable path in web root>`
  5. optionally set `RPORT`, `SSL`, and `VHOST`
  6. `exploit`
  7. **Verify** a new Meterpreter session is started
  
## Options

  **TARGETURI**

  The MediaWiki base path, the URL path on which MediaWiki is exposed. This is normally `/mediawiki`, `/wiki`, or `/w`.

  **UPLOADPATH**

  Folder name where MediaWiki stores the uploads, make sure to use a relative path here. For a regular installation this is the `images` folder. This folder needs to be writable by MediaWiki and accessible from the web root. The exploit will try to create a PHP file in this location that will later be called through the web server.

  **CLEANUP**

  Set this to true (the default) to unlink the PHP file created by this exploit module. The cleanup code will only be called when the exploit is successful.

  **USERNAME**

  In case the wiki is configured as private, a read-only (or better) account is needed to exploit this issue. Provide the username of that account here.

  **PASSWORD**

  In case the wiki is configured as private, a read-only (or better) account is needed to exploit this issue. Provide the password of that account here.
