## Description

This module exploits an object injection vulnerability on files action.admin_bulk_template in DesignManager module (that is installed by default from CMS Made Simple). With an unprivileged user with Designer permission, it is possible reach an unserialize function with a crafted value in the m1_allparms parameter that lead in a RCE.

Tested on CMS Made Simple 2.2.6, 2.2.7, 2.2.8, 2.2.9 and 2.2.9.1.

## Vulnerable Application

Affecting CMS Made Simple, version 2.2.6, 2.2.7, 2.2.8, 2.2.9, 2.2.9.1

## Verification Steps

1. Setting up a working installation of CMS Made Simple (CMSMS)
2. [OPTIONALLY] setting up a new user, assign it to a group and set the *Designer* permissions on group
3. Start `msfconsole`
4. `use exploit/multi/http/cmsms_object_injection_rce`
5. `set RHOST <IP>`
6. `set USERNAME <USERNAME>`
7. `set PASSWORD <PASSWORD>`
8. `check`
9. You should see `The target appears to be vulnerable.`
10. `exploit`
11. You should get a meterpreter session!

## Options

* **TARGETURI**: Path to CMS Made Simple (CMSMS) App installation (“/” is the default)
* **USERNAME**: Username to authenticate with
* **PASSWORD**: Password to authenticate with
