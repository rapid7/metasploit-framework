Cisco Prime Infrastructure (CPI) contains two basic flaws that when exploited allow an unauthenticated attacker to achieve 
remote code execution. The first flaw is a file upload vulnerability that allows the attacker to upload and execute files 
as the Apache Tomcat user; the second is a privilege escalation to root by bypassing execution restrictions in a SUID binary.

## Vulnerable Application

        This module exploits these vulnerabilities to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution
        as root on the CPI default installation.
        This module has been tested with CPI 3.2.0.0.258 and 3.4.0.0.348. Earlier and later versions
        might also be affected, although 3.4.0.0.348 is the latest at the time of writing.
        The file upload vulnerability should have been fixed in versions 3.4.1 and 3.3.1 Update 02.
             
        The vulnerable virtual appliances can be obtained by Cisco customers from the Cisco software 
        download portal.
