# Bludit Directory Traversal Image File Upload Vulnerability

## Description

This module exploits a vulnerability in Bludit: A simple, fast, "secure", flat-file CMS. A vulnerability was found by [christasa](https://github.com/christasa) in the image uploading feature. A remote user could the uuid parameter in the upload feature in order to save a malicious payload anywhere onto the server, and then use a custom .htaccess file to bypass the file extension check, and finally get remote code execution.

## Setup

1. Set up a Ubuntu box with Apache, PHP, and MySQL.
2. Download: https://www.bludit.com/releases/bludit-3-9-2.zip
3. Follow the installation guide [here](https://docs.bludit.com/en/getting-started/installation-guide). Make sure your Apache server sets `AllowOverride All` in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf.
