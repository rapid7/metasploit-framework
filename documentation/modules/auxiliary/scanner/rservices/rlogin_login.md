## Vulnerable Application

The R Services (rexecd, rlogind, and rshd) are a suite of unencrypted remote command/login services developed in the 1980s.
These services are all but unused in modern computing, as they have been replace by telnet and ssh.

The following was done on Kali linux:

  1. `apt-get install rsh-server` which includes: `rexecd`, `rlogind` and `rshd`.
  2. Start the service: `service openbsd-inetd start`

## Verification Steps

  1. Install and configure rexec
  2. Start msfconsole
  3. Do: `use auxiliary/scanner/rservices/rlogin_login`
  4. Do: `set rhosts`
  5. Set any other credentials that will need to be set
  6. Do: `run`

## Scenarios

  A run against the configuration from these docs

  ```
    msf > use auxiliary/scanner/rservices/rlogin_login
    msf auxiliary(rlogin_login) > set rhosts 10.1.2.3
    rhosts => 10.1.2.3
    msf auxiliary(rlogin_login) > set password test
    password => test
    msf auxiliary(rlogin_login) > set username test
    username => test
    msf auxiliary(rlogin_login) > run

## Confirming using NMAP

Utilizing [rlogin-brute](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/rlogin-brute.html)

  ```
    nmap -p 513 --script rlogin-brute 10.1.2.3

    Starting Nmap 7.40 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-05-11 20:07 EDT
