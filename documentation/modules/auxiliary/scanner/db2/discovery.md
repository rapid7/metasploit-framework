## Description

This module simply queries the DB2 discovery service for information.
The discovery service is integrated with the Configuration Assistant and the DB2Â® administration server.
Using the discovery method, catalog information for a remote server can be automatically generated in the local database and node directory.

## Verification Steps

1. `use auxiliary/scanner/db2/discovery`
2. `set RHOSTS [target address range/cidr]`
3. `set THREADS [number of threads]`
4. `run`

## Scenarios

### DB2 9.07.2 on RHEL 6.9

```
msf auxiliary(scanner/db2/discovery) > set RHOSTS 192.168.1.25
msf auxiliary(scanner/db2/discovery) > run

[+] Host 192.168.1.25 node name is SERVER02 with a product id of SQL09072
[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed

msf auxiliary(scanner/db2/discovery) > 
```
* The same output is expected on other versions of DB2, with the correspondent DB2 version at the product ID.
  - Example: DB2 9.07.2 outputs the product ID `SQL9072`, while DB2 7.02.9 outputs the product ID `SQL7029`.
