## Description
  
   This module will enumerate open TCP services by performing a full TCP connect on each port. This will establish a complete three-way handshake (SYN -> SYN/ACK -> ACK) on the target port. This does not need administrative privileges on the source machine, which may be useful if pivoting.

## Vulnerable Application

  Any reachable TCP endpoint is a potential target.

## Options

  **PORTS**

  This is the list of ports to test for TCP Scan on each host.
  Formats like  `1-3`, `1,2,3`, `1,2-3`, etc. are all supported. Default
  options is to scan `1-10000` ports.
 
  **ConnectTimeout**

  This options states the maximum number of seconds to establish a tcp 
  connection. Default value if `10`.
 
  **VERBOSE**

  Gives detailed message about the scan of all the ports. It also shows the
  ports that were closed.

## Verification Steps

  1. Do: ```use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp```
  2. Do: ```set RHOSTS [IP]```
  3. Do: ```set PORTS [PORTS]```
  4. Do: ```run```
