## Description

This auxiliary module probes the local network for IPv6 hosts that respond to Neighbor Solicitations with a link-local address. This module, like the arp_sweep one, will generally only work within the attacking machineâ€™s broadcast domain. It serves the dual-purpose of showing what hosts are online similar to arp_sweep and then performs the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery.

## Verification Steps

1. Do: ```use auxiliary/scanner/discovery/ipv6_neighbor```
2. Do: ```set RHOSTS [IP]```
3. Do: ```set SHOST [IP]```
4. Do: ```set SMAC [MAC]```
5. Do: ```set THREADS [number of threads]```
6. Do: ```run```

## Scenarios

```
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/discovery/ipv6_neighbor
msf auxiliary(ipv6_neighbor) > set RHOSTS 192.168.1.2-254
RHOSTS => 192.168.1.200-254
msf auxiliary(ipv6_neighbor) > set SHOST 192.168.1.101
SHOST => 192.168.1.101
msf auxiliary(ipv6_neighbor) > set SMAC d6:46:a7:38:15:65
SMAC => d6:46:a7:38:15:65
msf auxiliary(ipv6_neighbor) > set THREADS 55
THREADS => 55
msf auxiliary(ipv6_neighbor) > run
