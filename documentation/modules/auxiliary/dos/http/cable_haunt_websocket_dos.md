## Vulnerable Application

Sagecom F@st-3890 Cable Modems

Please note that successful completion of this module will most likely knock out upstream network services, including any remote sessions connected through the cable modem.

## Options

**WS_USERNAME**

This is the basic auth username for the spectrum analysis web service.  This is typically default credentials such as `admin:password` but may also be something along the lines of `spectrum:spectrum`.  This will vary from manufacturer to manufacturer and ISP to ISP.

**WS_PASSWORD**

This is the basic auth password for the spectrum analysis web service.

**TIMEOUT**

This is the timeout in seconds that the module should wait before making a conclusion on the success of the payload delivery.  Typically, the device crashes within about 5 second of the payload being delivered.  The default value of `15` should be seen as the lower bound for `TIMEOUT` values.

**RHOSTS**

Typically the only address which should be used for this value is `192.168.100.1`. It can be different, but not in a well-secured configuration.

**RPORT**

On some devices the Spectrum Analysis web service runs on port `8080`, though Lyrebirds (the original discoverer and PoC author) notes that sometimes it can run on port `6080`.
