The following is the recommended format for module documentation. But feel free to add more content/sections to this.
One of the general ideas behind these documents is to help someone troubleshoot the module if it were to stop
functioning in 5+ years, so giving links or specific examples can be VERY helpful.

## Vulnerable Application

Instructions to get the vulnerable application. If applicable, include links to the vulnerable install
files, as well as instructions on installing/configuring the environment if it is different than a
standard install. Much of this will come from the PR, and can be copy/pasted.

## Verification Steps
Example steps in this format (is also in the PR):

1. Install the application
1. Start msfconsole
1. Do: `use [module path]`
1. Do: `run`
1. You should get a shell.

## Options
List each option and how to use it.

### Option Name

Talk about what it does, and how to use it appropriately. If the default value is likely to change, include the default value here.

## Scenarios
Specific demo of using the module that might be useful in a real world scenario.

### Version and OS

```
code or console output
```

For example:

To do this specific thing, here's how you do it:

```
msf > use module_name
msf auxiliary(module_name) > set POWERLEVEL >9000
msf auxiliary(module_name) > exploit
```
